            <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-sm border-l-4 border-teal">
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                <strong>1.</strong> Because you are done being told what is "normal." Ditch the processed junk and show the world you are in charge.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-sm border-l-4 border-teal">
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                <strong>Note on Macronutrients (including FIBER):</strong> Carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and fiber are the building blocks your body needs in larger amounts for energy, structure, and optimal function.

            </div>
            <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-sm border-l-4 border-teal">
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                <strong>2.</strong> Because you have zero interest in fading into the background. A plant powered life keeps your glow strong and your energy fierce.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-sm border-l-4 border-teal">
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                <strong>3.</strong> Because rebels do not settle for pills when plants can heal. Heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, inflammatory and chronic diseases. Nope, you are rewriting your health story.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-sm border-l-4 border-teal">
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                <strong>4.</strong> Because you can not stand being part of the problem. You want your plate to match your values, kind to animals, kind to the planet.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-sm border-l-4 border-teal">
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                <strong>5.</strong> Because you're sick of diets that steal your joy. No calorie counting needed. Plants nourish, satisfy and taste amazing and they all go together and compliment each other. This is food freedom.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-sm border-l-4 border-teal">
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                <strong>6.</strong> Because you are too wise to fall for marketing hype. The food giants want you hooked. You? You want to thrive.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-sm border-l-4 border-teal">
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                <strong>7.</strong> Because the future needs rebels like you. Every plant based meal is a stand for a better world, for your kids, your grandkids and beyond.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-sm border-l-4 border-teal">
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                <strong>8.</strong> Because confidence starts at your core. What you feed your body feeds your spirit and your rebel soul is hungry for good fuel.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-sm border-l-4 border-teal">
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                <strong>9.</strong> Because you are here to sparkle, not struggle. Plants help you feel light, strong and ready to dance through life.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-sm border-l-4 border-teal">
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                <strong>10.</strong> Because you're not waiting for permission. You are leading the charge. Rebels don't ask, they act.

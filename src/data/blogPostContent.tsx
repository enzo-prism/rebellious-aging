            Let's set the table for something deliciously different.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I am excited to talk with you about something that has transformed my life. It is the Whole Food Plant Based (WFPB) lifestyle. Yup, not a diet but a lifestyle, for health and vitality with the added bonus of your body automatically regulating your weight if you follow the science.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            My goal is not to preach or persuade, but to create awareness that this powerful, evidence based way of eating exists. Hey, it might just be the missing piece that you have been looking for.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            No judgement here, just a big open heart and a sincere desire to share what I have learned, offer you clear, accurate information, and point you toward the science so you can explore for yourself. This is your invitation to pull up a chair and dig into the facts, rebelliously, of course.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            So whether you're just nibbling at the idea or ready to dive fork first into this lifestyle, remember, knowledge is power.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Let's rebel against confusion. Let's begin with a list of definitions before we dig deep, so that we are all on the same page. Clarity is power.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            When you understand what is really on your plate, you can make choices that fuel your vitality, confidence, and health.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Let's rebel against confusion, reclaim our health, and rediscover joy in eating.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Sparkle on, Rebels. The revolution is deeeelish.

            The Rebellious Guide to What is on Your Plate.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Simple Carbohydrates</strong><br />
            These are fast-burning carbs made of just one or two sugar molecules. They digest quickly, give you a quick spike of energy, and soon after comes the CRASH!<br />
            Think Candy, sodas, pastries, white bread, sugary cereals and much more. They are like fireworks. They are bright and sparkly and exciting. They are over in a flash.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Complex Carbohydrates</strong><br />
            These take longer to digest because they're made of longer sugar chains. That means more stable blood sugar, lasting energy and a happier digestive system.<br />
            Think, sweet potatoes, oats, brown rice, lentils, quinoa, veggies beans and much more.<br />
            They are like a slow burning candle, steady, warm, filling and reliable.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Vegetarian</strong><br />
            No meat, poultry or fish. You can include eggs, dairy, cheese and processed foods.<br />
            Think, cheese pizza, veggie lasagna, yogurt parfaits.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Vegan</strong><br />
            No animal products at all. No meat, no dairy, no eggs, no honey.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Whole Food Plant Based (WFPB)</strong><br />
            Focuses on whole, minimally processed plant foods. Fruits, veggies, grains, beans, legumes, nuts, seeds. No meat, dairy, eggs, oils, sugar or heavily processed products.<br />
            Think of nourishing your body for health, vitality and sparkle.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Quick Recap</strong><br />
            Vegetarian=no meat<br />
            Vegan= no meat, no animal products<br />
            WFPB=Plants
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Macronutrients</strong><br />
            The big three your body needs in large amounts<br />
            Carbohydrates, Proteins, Fats<br />
            Think, the main event on your plate.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Micronutrients</strong><br />
            Vitamins and minerals your body needs in tiny amounts to function well.<br />
            Think of the behind the scenes crew making the show run smoothly.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            You need both to sparkle inside and out!

            Different Types of Fasting
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Intermittent Fasting (IF)</strong><br />
            Eat during a set window (e.g., 16:8, 14:10, 12:12).
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>5:2 Fasting.</strong> Eat normally for 5 days, restrict calories for two non consecutive days.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Time Restricted Eating</strong><br />
            Eat in the daylight. Early dinner, no late snacks.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Prolonged Fasting</strong><br />
            Fast 24 hours or longer. Only under medical guidance.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Modified Fasts</strong><br />
            Eat very small amounts to mimic fasting benefits ( usually Therapeutic).
          </p>
          
          <p>
            NOTE: Fasting is not about punishment. It is about pause and purpose.

            WFPB vs Top Diet Trends
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Keto:</strong> High fat, low carb, heavy on meat and oils. Quick weight loss results, but lacks fiber and long term benefits.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Paleo:</strong> Whole foods, but excludes legumes and grains. Leans on animal products.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Mediterranean:</strong> Balanced, plant leaning, includes fish and oils.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>WFPB:</strong> All plants, no oil, no sugar, no salt, no processed foods. Based on science built for longevity and healing.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Note: Fad diets chase results. WFPB builds a healthy, confident life.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Gut Health: Your Secret Garden</strong><br />
            Support it with fiber, fermented foods ,and plant variety. Avoid processed foods, sugars, oils and animal fats. Think of your gut like a garden, nurture it with whole plants.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Label Reading for Rebels</strong><br />
            Watch for added sugars, oils, sodium, artificial ingredients. Choose short clean ingredient lists you recognize
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Note: If it reads like a science project, maybe it belongs in the lab, not your kitchen.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I hope this helps to clarify misconceptions.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Let's rebel against confusion, reclaim our health, and rediscover joy in eating one bite at a time.

            The WFPB lifestyle is NOT a diet. It is a lifestyle which promotes better health, greater energy, and a deeper connection with the way humans chose to nourish themselves. It has been proven to be better for humans, the animals and the planet.
          </p>

          <p>
            Studies show that a WFPB diet can help prevent or manage or reverse chronic conditions like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, autoimmune diseases, obesity, adult on-set diabetes, certain types of cancer, dementia and a host of other ailments linked to diet including impotence.

            <strong>Whole Food Plant Based Defined:</strong><br />
            Think from the garden not the farm or factory.
          </p>

          <p>
            No animals (nothing with a momma), including sea animals.<br />
            No animal by products<br />
            No processed foods<br />
            Limit sugar, oil and salt
          </p>

          <p>
            WFPB focuses on optimal health and whole nutrient dense foods. It emphasizes eating minimally processed, whole plant foods such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds.
          </p>

          <p>
            Embrace the delight of all fruits and veggies, grains, nuts and seeds in as close to their original state as possible. <strong>Note:</strong> Calorie Density is important to consider if weight is an issue. Think nuts and avocados vs kale and lettuce.

Recently retired and founder of the global community, T Colin Campbell Center for Nutrition Studies. His groundbreaking work advocating for a WFPB lifestyle as a means to prevent and even reverse chronic diseases has inspired millions to rethink their relationship with food and embrace the power of plants for optimal health.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Dr Campbell:</strong> "I propose to do nothing less than redefine what we think of as good nutrition. The provocative results of my four decades of experimental research, including the findings from a 27 year laboratory program, prove that eating right can save your life". "The China Study"

          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Where do you get your protein?</strong> The same place many animals do including but not limited to cows, chickens and pigs. These animals consume plants and synthesize the amino acids from the proteins in those plants. When humans eat meat, they are indirectly consuming the protein that originally came from the plants that the animals ate. So by eating plant foods directly one can "cut out the middleman" and still meet protein requirements efficiently. There are 40 + animals that go directly to the source, elephants, gorillas, hippos, etc..
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>NOTE:</strong> All plants contain protein, in varying amounts. Legumes, soy, whole grains, nuts and seeds are rich sources, while even vegetables provide some. Here is a short list , spinach, broccoli, kale, brussel sprouts, asparagus, artichokes, mushrooms, collard greens, mustard greens, watercress.
          </p>

          <p>
            Eating a variety of plant foods ensures all essential amino acids, making plant-based diets fully capable of meeting protein needs.
          </p>

            There is so much to unpack regarding WFPB eating. I will offer this red flag, <strong>BEWARE OF PROCESSED FOODS</strong> and products labeled VEGAN. Best to stick to foods without labels.

            "One of the surprising findings in our study is that, for many people, it is easier to make BIG changes in diet and lifestyle than to make only moderate ones. Although this goes against conventional wisdom, we found it to be true. When people make only moderate changes in diet and life-style, they have the worst of both worlds. They have the sense of deprivation because they are not able to eat and do everything they want, but they are not making changes big enough to make them feel much better or to have much effect on their weight, their cholesterol, or their health. On the other hand, when people make comprehensive changes in their diet and lifestyle, they begin to feel so much better, so quickly that the choices become clear, and for many people, worth making".

          <p>There was a time I dressed to impress. Now? I dress to express.</p>

          <p>My closet is no longer a holding pen for solid black. (A guy I worked for once told me, if you want to be taken seriously in this biz, wear black, to say that had an impression on me is an understatement). But truth be known I expect black is the "little black power move of the color world". I drank the Kool Aid and for many years wore black, ONLY. My philosophy has always included, "if a little is good, a lot is better."</p>

          <p>My closet is no longer a holding pen for black. It is my personal gallery of courage, mood and sometimes sequins. You will spot bright scarves, leopard and zebra prints, bright pink heels, my favorite red party skirt, shirts of many colors, some of which sparkle bright. A shelf of colorful hats, crazy socks, bright purses and chunky colorful jewelry. I am working toward breaking up with black, one step at a time. However, it is a slow agonizing break up because black has so much to give: check this out, after much pondering and thoughtfulness and questioning friends, I came up with a Pro Black List.</p>

          <p>
            <strong>I am in charge.</strong><br />
            <strong>I've got mystery - and I am keeping some for myself</strong><br />
            <strong>I am deliberate</strong><br />
            <strong>I am here to focus</strong><br />
            <strong>I know my power and I do not need to shout.</strong><br />
            Hmmmmmmmm?
          </p>

          <p>This post is a letter to that space, a different time, the jackets that carry memories, the scarves that still smell faintly of old adventures, the shoes that remind me who I was (and still am, just a newer version). It's about the joy of reaching for a piece that makes me feel like me, and the quiet confidence that comes from showing up in something that whispers, "I've still got it but in a sassy classy way."</p>

          <p>I have lived long enough to know the fashion rules, and to BREAK them all. White after Labor Day, of course. Florals and stripes, so good. Red lipstick, a favorite silk blouse with jeans, sneakers and a baseball cap, classy redefined. Why not? Rebels radiate.</p>

          <p>At 83, I no longer wonder, "Can I pull this off?" Instead I wonder? "Do I feel like myself in this and especially spectacular"? If the answer is yes, on, it goes.</p>

          <p>But here's the thing, I didn't just stumble into enjoying fashion. I have been intrigued since I was a little girl. There is a difference, you already know this, between FASHION and STYLE. I think unknowingly I chased the latter.</p>

          <p>I recall being in 7th grade. I only had a few clothing items. I loved creating new outfits from what I had. I enjoyed reinventing what hung in my closet. I would find ways to tweak, change, and reinvent each piece to feel new. The day I used my dad's bright red plaid robe belt and proudly tied it around my waist to change the look of the "same old" was a day I will always remember. The compliments flew and I became unstoppable. It wasn't about labels or trends, it was about attitude, imagination and sass.</p>

          <p>A few months ago, someone dear to me said, in conversation, "Well, you have your own unique style, it's easy for you." I was shocked. At 83, it had never dawned on me that what I'd been doing all of these years, tweaking, layering, adding robe belts like runway sashes, was style. It was not about effortlessness. It was about love.</p>

          <p>So here's my rebellious whisper to you. Don't fade. Don't apologize. Don't tuck yourself into black. Wear the thing you always wanted to wear, the way you want to wear it. The vintage purple hat, the red lipstick, the statement jacket you thought might be "too much". This is your time to SPARKLE, and to radiate unapologetic style.</p>

          <p>Refuse to become invisible. Your closet is a mirror. Let it reflect your energy, your evolution, your essence. Try something unexpected. Let your closet be the playground it was always meant to be.</p>

          <p>What's hanging in your closet that is begging to dance again?</p>

          <p>There was no grand epiphany. No milestone birthday. Just a bowl of wild blueberries.</p>
          <p>I eat at least two cups of these lovelies every day. I love them, possibly I'm addicted. I crave them. I believe they are part of the reason I have more energy in my 80s than I did in my 40s. They were my anti-aging secret weapon...or so I thought.</p>
          <p>Then one day, recently, I left the house without checking the mirror. I was feeling pretty good. Possibly even fabulous. And then someone said, &quot;You have something blue around your mouth.&quot;</p>
          <p>Oh boy, it was not &quot;just around&quot;. It was in my mouth lines. Nestled neatly in the deep, confident grooves life has etched around my lips. The wild blueberry juice had settled there like a bold little truth. (I have been eating wild blueberries daily for over six years and I had never noticed such a thing happening.)</p>
          <p>And just like that, I knew clearly. I had crossed over. I was officially in the category of &quot;OLD.&quot;</p>
          <p>That was the moment my rebellion revved up and here we are.</p>
          <p>I am not rebelling against age itself, but against what the world thinks age should look like—unhealthy, quiet, dismissed, invisible, diminished. For sure not this Rebel.</p>
          <p>I wiped the blue stains from my wrinkles, threw on some lip gloss, and continued with wild determination to build my movement with a more serious intention. One that says you can be 83, radiant, healthy, vibrant, wrinkled, bold, and blooming, sometimes with blueberry juice as proof.</p>
          <p>So now? I eat my blueberries with pride. I check the mirror, sure. But I never hide. Because these lines? They have earned the right to sparkle. And this Rebel? She is just getting started.</p>

          <p>Yesterday when Enzo and I were recording a video about the three pillars of Rebellious Aging, I blurted out, I must include a fourth pillar, gratitude. Enzo agreed and so of course a blog about gratitude must follow my outburst.</p>

          <p>Gratitude is a powerful tool, not just for joy, but for health, confidence, and longevity. It's not just about saying thank you. It is about the way we see the world, and the way we show up in it.</p>

          <p>Gratitude is not passive. It is not just being polite or listing what you are thankful for at Thanksgiving dinner (although that does matter). It is more of a mindset, a way of paying attention to what is good and worthy, even in the midst of chaos, change, or aging knees that creak a little louder each year.</p>

          <p>Real gratitude acknowledges life as it is, while also celebrating what's still possible. It turns "why me?" into "what now?" and "I used to" into "I get to."</p>

          <p><strong>Here is where the sparkle meets the science: practicing gratitude actually rewires your brain.</strong><br />
          Neuroscientists have found that regularly reflecting on what you are grateful for boosts levels of dopamine and serotonin, the brain's "feel good" chemicals. It even strengthens neural pathways associated with emotional regulation and empathy. In other words: the more you practice gratitude, the more natural it becomes to feel joy and connection and peace.</p>

          <p>A fascinating study from UC Davis found that people who kept a gratitude journal for just ten weeks reported feeling more optimistic, exercising more, and visiting doctors less than those who focused on daily hassles. Yup, that is right, thankfulness might actually be better than a pharmaceutical supplement.</p>

          <p><strong>Gratitude matters, especially as we age.</strong> When we are younger, gratitude often feels like a luxury or is ignored completely. As we age? It becomes a necessity.</p>

          <p>Gratitude anchors us. It softens the sting of loss and aging. It brings perspective to change. It helps us remember we are still here, still learning, still capable, still able to make an impact. Gratitude is an act of rebellion in a world that tells us aging is declining. No way, we are rising with great health, confidence, grace, style and gumption.</p>

          <p><strong>Here are a few ways to infuse more gratitude into your life.<br />
          (Without Making It a Chore)</strong></p>

          <p><strong>*Before your feet hit the floor, name one thing you are grateful for.</strong> A soft pillow counts. So does waking up.</p>

          <p><strong>*Take a 10 minute stroll and silently thank your body, the trees, the sky or whatever catches your eye.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>* Keep a small notebook by your bed and jot down three things each night that made your day better.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>* Call or text someone and tell them exactly what you appreciate about them.</strong> Don't wait.</p>

          <p><strong>*Annoyed that your joints ache after gardening?</strong> Flip it to "I am grateful, I am strong enough to dig in the dirt and grow beautiful things."</p>

          <p>I think you get the point, right?</p>

          <p>Gratitude is not a trend. It's a transformation. For the rebellious ager, it is one of the most powerful tools in your kit. Not because it is easy, but because it is real. Gratitude grounds you, heals you, and helps you rise.</p>

          <p>So go ahead and make gratitude your daily rebellion. Not just because it is good for your brain (which it is), but because it reminds you how rich your life truly is.</p>

      <>

        <div className="prose max-w-none space-y-4 mb-16">
          <p>I came across an article in the Guardian this morning and I thought it was worthy of a share. It was written by Dr. Kerry Burnight. I am inspired by Dr. Kerry's wisdom as I feel it aligns with my message here at Rebellious Aging.</p>

          <p>Here is my Blog on her article.</p>

          <p>What if ageing wasn't something to fear, fight, or fix. Rather something to expand into with joy, purpose, and rebellious spark? Dr. Kerry is one of America's leading gerontologists and believes exactly that and as a Rebel I could not agree more.</p>

          <p>In the article, titled "I'm an Expert on Aging. Here is What I Know about Thriving in Later Life," Dr Burnight shares the kind of wisdom that deserves a drumroll, and maybe a dance break.</p>

          <p>Here is what she says we need to do to truly thrive.</p>

          <p><strong>Forget about just adding years to your life (lifespan) or even adding life to your years (healthspan).</strong> Dr. Kerry introduces the reader to a richer, deeper concept. Joyspan. Which is living with connection, purpose, and the kind of soul deep contentment that makes aging feel like a privilege, not a penalty.</p>

          <p>Now that is rebellious.</p>

          <p><strong>Here are her essentials, they are not optional.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Keep learning.</strong> Stay curious. Try new things. Yes, even if it scares you a little, or a lot.. That is the point. A curious mind keeps us alive, engaged, and fabulously unpredictable.</p>

          <p><strong>Relationships are the elixir.</strong> Whether it's rekindling old friendships, hugging tighter, or even starting new connections online, being seen and known matters.</p>

          <p><strong>Change is a constant companion in later life.</strong> The key? Flexibility. Grace. Maybe even a sense of humor, when gravity starts getting sassy.</p>

          <p><strong>Your life experience has value.</strong> Share it. Mentor, support, volunteer, or simply smile at someone who looks lost. Giving adds meaning and texture to our days.</p>

          <p>Dr. Burnright paints a vivid contrast between two women. One is resigned to decline, the other is lit up with curiosity and confidence. The difference was not luck or money. It was Mindset.</p>

          <p>Reading this article reminded me that the work we are doing here, embracing radiant health, confidence and unapologetic style, is not superficial. It's survival. It's joy. It's rebellion.</p>

          <p>To grow, connect, adapt, and give, that 's what we Rebels do best.</p>

          <p>Not sure where to begin? Start with one tiny act of rebellion. Try something new. If you need a little nudge, I've got your back. Reach out and join our community.</p>

          <p><strong>Feeling inspired?</strong> For the next seven days, choose one small action to grow, connect, adapt or give. Keep a note, share your favorite moment. Let joy surprise you.</p>

    ),
    body: (
      <>

        <div className="prose max-w-none space-y-4 mb-16">
          <p>Who knew a shop window could deliver a life lesson? One early morning, glance, stopped me in my tracks and got me thinking about posture, presence, and how we carry ourselves through the years. A gentle nudge for all of us Rebels.</p>

          <p>It started as just another peaceful morning walk with my pup, Gabe.</p>

          <p>We took a different route today. One that wound us through the quiet charm of downtown. As the sun peeked over the buildings and Gabe sniffed his way through the sidewalk stories of the day, I caught a glimpse of myself in a shop window.</p>

          <p>I stopped, stunned. Shoulders slumped. Back rounded. My body was speaking, not in the way I wanted it to.</p>

          <p>I instantly thought of my mom. She had a thing about porture as I was growing up. "Stand tall", she'd say, tapping gently on my shoulders. "Good posture shows self respect."</p>

          <p>She was right.</p>

          <p>Posture is not just about looking elegant, it is about aging with confidence, strength, and even safety. It affects balance, energy, mood, digestion, and how the world sees us. And more importantly, how we see ourselves.</p>

          <p>As we age, our bodies naturally change. Poor posture can speed up the process and steal joy from everyday moments.</p>

          <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
          <p>Rounded shoulders can tighten the chest and restrict breathing.<br/>
          Slouching weakens core and back muscles.<br/>
          Poor alignment increases fall risk and spinal compression.<br/>
          It can even lower confidence and mood because body language is a language.</p>

          <p>Here is the good news, it is never too late to straighten up.</p>

          <p><strong>Gentle Ways to Stand Tall</strong></p>

          <p>Here are a few simple things I am doing now (and you can too!)<br/>
          Sticky Note Reminders<br/>
          I include the following in my morning stretch and workout routine.</p>

          <p className="ml-8"><strong>A. The Wall Test</strong><br/>
          Stand with your back against a wall. Heels, tailbone, shoulders, and the back of your head touching the wall. Hold for 30 seconds. Repeat several times.</p>

          <p className="ml-8"><strong>B. Daily Posture Reset Stretch</strong><br/>
          Try this quick sequence.<br/>
          Roll shoulders up, back and down<br/>
          Tuck chin gently to lengthen the neck<br/>
          Lift your chest slightly and breathe deeply<br/>
          Engage your core like you are zipping up a snug coat.<br/>
          Hold for 10 seconds. Repeat often.</p>

          <p>So the shop window moment could have spiraled into self criticism. Instead, it became a nudge, a reminder that Rebellious Aging is not about perfection. It is about paying attention, making tweaks, and moving forward with self love and attention.</p>

          <p>We deserve to take up space.<br/>
          To walk with pride.<br/>
          To show the world we are not invisible but still rising.</p>

          <p><strong>CTA: Rebel homework.</strong> Stand before a mirror or a shop window, and do your own posture check and correct.</p>

          <p>Leave a comment and let's straighten up together.</p>

        <div className="prose max-w-none space-y-4 mb-16">
          <p>Let's be honest. When you mention to other humans that you are eating mostly plants, the reactions range from curious to downright skeptical. The first question is usually about where do you get your protein? Followed by, isn't it expensive? Followed by the statement, Sounds like a lot of work.</p>

          <p>I know you have been wondering the same. These are my most asked questions. These myths have been around longer than tofu has been on supermarket shelves. Here's the truth. A whole Food Plant Based (WFPB) lifestyle is not extreme, it is evidence-based, empowering, simple, delicious, life changing, health changing, weight changing and doable at any age.</p>

          <p><strong>Let's Clear the Air.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Where do you get your protein?</strong> Duh, Simple answer: the same place the animal you just ate got their protein. PLANTS! Plants have plenty of protein. Here's a short list in no special order: peanut butter, soy milk, oat milk, lentils, beans, tofu, edamame, quinoa, oats, green peas, split peas, potatoes, kale, spinach and broccoli are all solid sources. Most Americans actually consume too much protein (A Future Blog). Checkout, NutritionFacts.org/protein</p>

          <p><strong>It's Too Expensive.</strong> Not if you do not want it to be. Just like anything else you have choices. Beans, rice, potatoes, oats, frozen veggies and in season produce are some of the cheapest and most nutritious foods on the planet. Whole Foods for the win!</p>

          <p><strong>It takes too much time to prepare.</strong> Again just like with the Standard American Diet (SAD) you have choices. If you are making an Instagram worthy Buddha bowl or Chef Aj's deelish Chocolate Mint Torte, maybe. (chefaj.com) WFPB can be as fast as an unglamorous but nutritious Buddha bowl, as fast as a bowl of chili, or a roasted sweet potato on a bed of greens smothered with your choice of an assortment of veggies topped with a great balsamic or salsa. Frozen veggies equal time saving brilliance. I am having a love affair with organic frozen kale and wild blueberries. Simple as simple is and quicker and healthier than take out. Replace the word EAT with Nourish, for the win.</p>

          <p><strong>It is ONLY for Young People.</strong> Actually the older we get, the more our bodies benefit from nutrient rich, anti-inflammatory foods. Aches, energy dips, blood pressure spikes? Plants for the win.</p>

          <p><strong>I Will Feel Deprived.</strong> Deprived of what, heartburn? Joint pain? Meds? Autoimmune Disease? Heart Disease. The truth is, many people discover more flavor, satisfaction, and joy in their meals when they go plant based. Your gut microbiome celebrates, your taste buds evolve, your energy returns, your weight stabilizes, your blood flows and your confidence blooms. Aging with grace and greens for the win.</p>

          <p>You have nothing to lose and so much to gain. You do not have to know everything to get started. You just have to be open. The WFPB lifestyle is not about perfection it is about progress and possibilities. And trust me, your body will thank you.</p>

          <p><strong>From Dr. T. Colin Campbell,</strong> A good diet is THE most powerful weapon against disease and sickness.</p>

          <p>Rebel on, eat well, and remember, you've got this.</p>

        <div className="prose max-w-none space-y-4 mb-16">
          <p>Let's get one thing straight. Those whispers in your head, ya know the ones saying you are too old, too late, not stylish enough, not smart enough, unhealthy, horribly out of shape, not ready, they are NOT the truth. (For those who are interested I will dive deeper into the science of who those sneaky voices belong to.) But for now let's go with this. They are old scripts. They are "hand me down" fears. Quite frankly, they are BORING! It is time to stop letting those outdated voices run the show.</p>

          <p>Limiting beliefs are sneaky. They wear disguises like "being realistic" or "just protecting from disappointment." But what they are really doing is shrinking YOU. They are keeping you from saying yes to that art class, trying a new hairstyle, hitting record on that video idea, or ditching making healthier food choices.</p>

          <p>Here is the TRUTH bomb. You do not have to believe every thought you think. May I suggest you read, "Don't Believe Everything You Think" (Why Your Thinking is the Beginning & End Of Suffering) by Joseph Nguyen.</p>

          <p>That voice in your head? It may sound like you, but it is NOT you. It is a collage of old rules, other people's opinions, and moments when your confidence got a bit bruised. You, my friend, are much better than that.</p>

          <p><strong>3 Simple Ways to Start Busting Through Limiting Beliefs.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Name it to Tame it.</strong><br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a limiting thought pops up, ya know like "I am too old to<br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin something new", say it out loud. Hearing it with your<br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;real voice often will reveal just how silly or outdated that<br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thought is.</p>

          <p><strong>Ask: Would I say this to a friend?</strong><br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your best friend came to you at 55, 65, or 83 saying, "I want<br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to try something new," would you ever say, "Nope, too late".<br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course not. You must treat yourself with the same<br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;compassion.</p>

          <p><strong>Gather Evidence to the Contrary.</strong><br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Write down all the times you did try something new and it<br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;went superbly. Or at the least, taught you something<br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;important.<br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not starting from scratch. You are starting from<br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience.</p>

          <p>Here's the thing. Confidence is definitely not about having all of the answers. It is more about trusting yourself enough to take the next step. If your knees are knocking and you are breaking out in a sweat, keep going. The great thing is you can be scared and still be powerful. How about this, "self doubt" can ride along for the journey, but it does not get to drive.</p>

          <p>We Rebels are NOT here to play small.</p>

          <p>We are here to live fully, loudly, and with the kind of sparkle that makes people stop and say, "I want whatever she's got."</p>

          <p><strong>Call to Action:</strong><br/>
          Is there a limiting belief that haunts you? Let it go. Write it down. Tear it up. Better yet burn it. Then take one rebellious action that proves it wrong. Need a cheerleader? I am here for you.</p>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We evolved to survive, not to shine. Your brain's primary job is to detect threats, like embarrassment, failure, or rejection. So when you think about doing something bold or unfamiliar (like starting a YouTube channel at 83) your brain may shout out, hold on, stay safe. This is just your amygdala doing its job. Helpful? Typically not.</p>

          <p>(Your amygdala is a small part of your brain, but it has a big job. It is a major processing center for emotions. It also links your emotions to many other brain abilities. It is a part of the larger network called the limbic system. These are parts of your brain that detect danger. They also play a role in behavior, emotional control and learning. Clevelandclinic.org.)</p>

          <p><strong>The Inner Critic is a Learned Voice</strong><br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of those critical thoughts are formed in childhood and reinforced over time. Psychologists call this internalized messaging, ideas you absorbed from your parents, teachers, peers, media and society. Messages like, don't draw attention to yourself, act your age, you are not the creative one. These become part of your subconscious belief system, repeated so often they feel like truth. But they are not true or even close. They are simply just well worn-mental grooves.</p>

          <p>Your subconscious belief systems are deeply ingrained, often unexamined, and can significantly influence thoughts, behaviors, and even physical health. These beliefs, formed in early childhood and beyond, operate largely outside of conscious awareness and can drive actions, shape interpretations of experiences and create self limiting patterns. Understanding and potentially modifying these beliefs can be a key component of personal growth and positive change. psychologytoday.com , see article, "Are Negative Core Beliefs Wrecking Your Life".</p>

          <p><strong>Default Mode Network (DMN)</strong><br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the brain network that lights up when you are not focused on a task. Like when you are daydreaming, remembering, or self reflecting. It is also where self critical chatter can thrive. When the DMN is overactive, it can fuel anxious or negative inner dialogue.</p>

          <p>Good news? Practices like mindfulness, journaling, and cognitive reframing help quiet this network and strengthen more empowering thoughts.</p>

          <p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong><br/>
          Those taunting voices in your head are a mix of subconscious programming, outdated survival wiring, and cultural conditioning. THEY ARE NOT YOU. You are the observer, the awareness, the Rebel who gets to decide which thoughts are welcome and WHICH NEED TO PACK THEIR BAGS AND MOVE ON.</p>

        <div className="prose max-w-none space-y-4 mb-16">
          <p>Let's be honest. When it comes to aging and fashion, society tends to hand us a beige cardigan and a pair of sensible shoes and whispers, "Please, just fade away". Gracefully, of course.</p>

          <p>Well thanks, but no thank you.</p>

          <p>Here at Rebellious Aging, we don't tone it down. <strong>WE TURN IT up.</strong><br/>
          Style isn't about following the rules. It is about expression, freedom, and yes, fun. It's about waking up looking in the mirror and saying, "That's ME, and I like/love what I see."</p>

          <p>Style isn't just surface stuff, it's a mirror into your inner world. The colors you wear, the shapes you choose, the accessories you throw on, the attitude you exude, well, they all tell a story. And you, dear Rebel are the author.</p>

          <p>This is your creation, your calling card, it does not have to make sense to anyone else. It just has to make you feel authentic, proud, and alive.</p>

          <p>Rebellious style is not about trends. (Unless you love them).<br/>
          It is definitely not about making you look younger. ( You have earned your years, wear them with pride and the sassy unapologetic Rebel you are becoming).</p>

          <p>It is not about dressing age-appropriately (whatever that means).</p>

          <p>But it is the following for sure. Feeling confident in your own skin. Dressing to match your mood. Giving yourself permission to try stuff, to play, to show up at breakfast wearing bright red lipstick. Be authentic, be gorgeous, be unapologetic, be <strong>BOLD</strong>.</p>

          <p><strong>Reminder!</strong> "Don't Let The Old Lady In."</p>

          <p>OK, so, let's start here. What is one item in your closet that feels most like you at the moment?  Pull it out, dust it off, try it on. Wear it this week. Bonus points if it makes you smile when you catch your reflection.</p>

          <p>So if you are ready to rethink your "style story", you are in the right place. We will be talking closet clean outs, joyful dressing, thrifting, upstyling, bold accessories, fab colors and slaying those old rules that say you have to disappear as you age.</p>

          <p>Let's Dazzle Together.</p>

        <div className="prose max-w-none space-y-4 mb-16">
          <p>Who says aging gracefully has to be slow and quiet? Not me. I believe in aging rebelliously. With a plate full of vibrant colors, flavors, and life giving nutrients. A WFPB lifestyle isn't just about "rabbit food." Instead it is a delicious rebellion against disease, fatigue, and mediocrity. And guess what? Science is on our side. Let's take a look at what the research says about eating plants and living brilliantly.</p>

          <p><strong>Reduced Risk of Chronic Disease</strong><br/>
          A whole Food Plant Based diet has shown to halt and even reverse coronary artery disease, (Esselstyn), lower cancer risk (Campbell's China Study) and improve blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes (Greger).</p>

          <p><strong>Improved Digestive Health</strong><br/>
          Fiber rich plant foods nourish a healthy gut microbiome, improve digestion, and may reduce colorectal cancer risk. (Bulsiewicz).</p>

          <p><strong>Lower Blood Pressure and Cholesterol</strong><br/>
          Plant diets reduce LDL cholesterol and blood pressure without medication side effects.(Esselstyn, Greger).</p>

          <p><strong>Weight Management and Metabolic Health</strong><br/>
          Low calorie density makes it easier to maintain a healthy weight while eating satisfying portions and not counting calories. (Campbell, Greger).</p>

          <p><strong>Anti-Inflammatory Effects</strong><br/>
          Antioxidants (substances that can help protect your cells from damage caused by unstable molecules called free radicals. Free radicals are by-products of normal cell processes and can contribute to various diseases) and phytonutrients (naturally occurring compounds found in plants that offer various health benefits) in plants reduce chronic inflammation linked to arthritis, heart disease, and cognitive decline (Greger, Bulsiewicz).</p>

          <p><strong>Healthspan and Quality of Life.</strong><br/>
          Plant predominant diets are associated with longer lifespan and lower rates of disability (Campbell, Greger).</p>

          <p><strong>Improved Energy and Recovery</strong><br/>
          Better blood flow, oxygen delivery, and reduced oxidative stress, boost stamina and recovery (Esselstyn, Greger).</p>

          <p>So here's the truth. You can tiptoe through the years, or you can charge in, fork first, and claim the health, energy and sparkle you deserve. A WFPB lifestyle isn't just about adding years to your life. It is about adding life to your years. The research is clear, plants are delicious, and over the top healthy  and the only thing missing is your decision to take the risk and dive in. So go ahead, and plate up some plants.</p>

    ),
    body: (
      <>

        <div className="prose max-w-none space-y-4 mb-16">
          <p>Fashion legends like Coco Channel, Christian Dior, and Yves St Laurent gave the world timeless rules for elegance. As rebels we just give these rules a wink and twist them into something uniquely ours. We have lived long enough to know that style is more than clothes. Style is about attitude, confidence, and a refusal to fade quietly into the background.</p>

          <p>So let's stroll down the runway of fashion wisdom from a few of the greats. And let's add our own rebellious twist.</p>

          <p>I love Coco Chanel's life story. So interesting. She believed in timelessness. Ya know the kind of style that feels right no matter the decade.<br/>
          So keep those timeless pieces if you have them or grab them second hand if you are lucky. But do not let them get dusty. That classic black Chanel jacket? Pair it with ripped jeans and leopard print sneakers. Chanel and pearls…..yummy. Layer those pearls with chunky chains. Remember style does not mean predictable.<br/>
          Shop vintage. So good.</p>

          <p>These sassy quotes from Coco, are priceless.</p>

          <p>"A girl should be two things:classy and fabulous." <strong>Coco</strong></p>

          <p>"Fashion changes, but style endures." <strong>Coco</strong></p>

          <p>"Dress shabbily and they remember the dress, dress impeccably and they remember the woman." <strong>Coco</strong></p>

          <p>"In order to be irreplaceable one must always be different." <strong>Coco</strong></p>

          <p>"The most courageous act is still to think of yourself." <strong>Coco</strong></p>

          <p>Coco's influence extended to accessories. She was a pioneer in mixing high and low, introducing the once radical idea of incorporating costume jewelry into her collections.<br/>
          Embodying her belief that "That a woman should mix fake and real. The point of jewelry is not to make a woman look rich but to adorn her; not the same thing." Chanel blended faux pearls and stones with natural elements, redefining the perception of luxury. (InStyle)</p>

          <p>Dior knew beauty was not about perfection. It was about joy. His distinct style is characterized by romanticism, sophistication, and attention to detail. He is well known for ultra feminine and highly sculpted clothing. This style dominated fashion in the decade following the second world war.</p>

          <p>"Happiness is the secret to all beauty; there is no beauty that is attractive without happiness." <strong>Dior</strong></p>

          <p>"Do not buy much but make sure what you buy is good." <strong>Dior</strong></p>

          <p>So my dear Rebel, wear what makes you feel happy *today*, not what you are used to wearing. If it sparks joy, it belongs on your body, not in a storage bin. Just Do It! Bring the special occasion pieces into everyday life. How about silk to the farmer's market, velvet to coffee with friends.</p>

          <p>Yves Saint Laurent, was renowned for revolutionizing women's fashion. He pushed boundaries by introducing groundbreaking designs like the smoking tuxedo, transparent blouses, switching gender roles and launching ready to wear fashion.</p>

          <p>"Fashion fades, style is eternal" <strong>YSL</strong></p>

          <p>Trends come and go, we are not here to chase every trend.<strong>YSL</strong></p>

          <p>So my dear Rebel, pick the trends you adore and ignore the rest.</p>

          <p>Style is about curating, not conforming.</p>

          <p>Mix eras fearlessly. Your favorite vintage blazer with modern sneakers or a Dior dress with a denim jacket.</p>

          <p>Own your signature, a trademark accessory, a favorite vintage necklace, stylish headband, gorgeous multicolor wrap, favorite scent, attention grabbing earrings, daring and colorful silky top, or your go to jacket that says, "YOU".</p>

          <p>Play with proportion. Try oversized with fitted, flowing structures.</p>

          <p>Play with designs, plaids with polka dots, bright colored animal prints and fabulous vintage bags.</p>

          <p>Tell texture stories. Velvet with denim, silk with leather, linen with chunky knits.</p>

          <p>Above all, make JOY your dress code. If it makes you happy it belongs in your rotation.</p>

          <p>Turn 'special occasion' into 'right now'. Wear silk. Rock the sequins. Strut the velvet.</p>

          <p>In the end style is not about following fashion. It is about owning your story. Curate your closet like you curate your life. Do it with confidence, joy, and a whole lot of rebellion. Show the world your unapologetic self.</p>

        <div className="prose max-w-none space-y-4 mb-16">
          <p>The Summer of 2025 has been one long crash course in awkward situations. Some mine, some borrowed from others, but all pointing to one glaring truth, I NEED BOUNDARIES. Watching people I care about struggle to set them, and knowing my own anxiety as I tried and sometimes succeeded but more often than not I failed miserably, showed me just how messy and necessary this work really is. Then on my morning walk today, a thought hit me, what if boundaries are actually a love language? Rather than walls to shut people out, but bridges to keep love, respect and sanity flowing.</p>
          
          <p>So let's back up for a moment and ask, what exactly are boundaries and why do we need them?</p>
          
          <p>Boundaries are the invisible lines that define where you end and the world begins. They are your "Velvet Rope", an invitation-only entrance into your emotional, mental, and physical space. They are not about pushing people out, they are about keeping you standing tall.</p>
          
          <p>I have decided that boundaries are necessary, I am sure you agree. But, darn, they are trouble to set up and implement.. Without boundaries, life becomes a free for all, and guess who gets the short end of the stick? YOU. ME.</p>
          
          <p>Boundaries are not ageist or elitist. Nope they are for every human who wants peace, dignity and joy. If someone tells you that they do not need boundaries, well, chances are they are benefitting from you not having any.</p>
          
          <p>Here are some reasons why you should "bother" setting boundaries.</p>
          <p>*They honor your time and energy.</p>
          <p>*They prevent burnout and resentment.</p>
          <p>*They teach others how you want to be treated.</p>
          
          <p>I think many avoid creating boundaries out of fear. Yes, fear of conflict, fear of being selfish, fear of not being liked. In the end boundaries don't make you less lovable. They make you more authentic.</p>
          
          <p>Boundaries actually sparkle. They clearly say, "I value me." People know where they stand. You have more energy and less drama. I think Brene' Brown (<a href="https://brenebrown.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-primary hover:underline">https://brenebrown.com/about/</a>) says it well. "Boundaries are a prerequisite for compassion and empathy. We can't connect, unless we are clear about where we end and they begin."</p>
          
          <p>I think setting boundaries is difficult especially for those of us who have been conditioned to say yes. There can be, will be, often is, pushback. Not everyone will "clap" over your new rules. Oh boy, and then there is the, "be nice voice in your head", that one, for sure, will not quiet easily.</p>
          
          <p>But here is the Rebel twist, the discomfort of setting boundaries is nothing compared to the misery of living without them. (Read that one again).</p>
          
          <p>I have learned so much from the following three amazing teachers.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Mel Robbins</strong> (<a href="https://www.melrobbins.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-primary hover:underline">https://www.melrobbins.com</a>), Mel's viral, "LET THEM THEORY" IS the ultimate boundary hack. Someone flakes? Let them.  Someone gossips? Let them. It is not your job to control other people. It is your job to control your response. This is so cool, so when you pair "Let Them" with "Let Me" as in, let me decide who I want to be and what I will accept. Now the magic, the boundaries shift from scary to empowering.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Brene' Brown</strong> (brenebrown.com), People with strong boundaries do not apologize for protecting their peace, resting, or saying "no" when they mean it.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Jay Shetty</strong> (<a href="https://jayshetty.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-primary hover:underline">jayshetty.com</a>) preaches that boundaries are not selfish, rather they are love in action. He and his wife have a firm rule, no work talk at dinner. Sacred time, sacred energy. Boundaries keep love alive because they build respect. Jay says you are NOT responsible for carrying other people's feelings on your back.</p>
          
          <p>So what do you think? Are Boundaries a Love Language of Sorts? We usually think of love languages as  sweet gestures, words of affirmation,  acts of service, gifts, touch or quality time. Here is the rebel truth, boundaries are a love language too. A love language to yourself, a radical act of self respect. To others, boundaries teach people how to treat you, they remove the guesswork. In relationships they are love in action, protecting intimacy and sacred time. Across generations, boundaries don't just protect your energy, they deepen your capacity to love. Yes they say that you can love fiercely without disappearing into someone else's needs.</p>
          
          <p>Rebels know every strong "no" is actually a braver, louder, "yes" to the relationships that matter most.</p>
          
          <p>So here's the deal, Rebels. Boundaries are not about pushing people away. They are about keeping yourself intact. They are the difference between living drained and living daringly. The beauty of aging rebelliously is that we finally get to drop the guilt, ditch the "good girl" script, and stand tall in our own space. Every "no" you speak is actually a louder "yes" to your health, joy and peace. So go ahead and draw the line, shut the door, or leave it wide open when it feels right. Boundaries are not barriers. They are the sparkle lines that make your life shine brighter.</p>
          
          <p>Sparkle on my dear Rebels.</p>

            Let's be honest, sugar is seductive. There is no upside to sugar.

          <p>
            It sneaks into your morning coffee, whispers from your cookie jar, and struts through the grocery store in shiny packaging. Sugar, as sweet and coy, and powerful as it is, is an anti-nutrient. Yup, you heard that right. It has been known to inhibit the absorption of other nutrients. Do not fall into the trap of falling for sugar's buddies, either. You know who I mean, high fructose corn syrup, palm sugar, brown sugar, to name a few and of course there are the chemical sweeteners aspartame, saccharin, sucrose, the list is long. Here's the rebellious truth, sugar is not your friend.

            Sugar gives you a quick high, then dumps you in a crash. Overtime, that ride leaves you drained, cranky, and constantly reaching for the next fix.
          </p>

          <p>
            Excess sugar stokes the flames of inflammation in your body, fueling everything from joint pain to accelerated aging.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sugar hides under dozens of names. Learning to spot it on labels is one of the most rebellious things you can do for your health.
          </p>

          <p>
            Too much sugar clouds your memory, fuels cravings, and disrupts sleep. Rebels need clarity, confidence and sparkle, not fog.

            Breaking up with sugar does not mean never enjoying sweetness again. It means choosing whole, plant based foods that fuel your body instead of draining it. Do not underestimate the ability of fresh fruit to satisfy your craving. Dates and date paste will sweeten up baked goods.

          <p>
            Rebellious Aging isn't about deprivation. It is about freedom. Freedom from cravings, mood swings, and health risks that sugar drags along with it. By saying No to Sugar, you are saying yes to energy, clarity, and confidence at every age.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here's to Rebels who sparkle without the sugar rush.

                  <p>Title: “Eat the Olive, Not the Oil”</p>
                  <p>Oil has a shiny reputation. Olive oil, avocado oil, coconut oil, you have seen them all and others marketed as “healthy fats”. The truth is oil is oil. Ok some oils might be worse than others but NO Oil is healthy.</p>
                  <p>At its core, oil is pure fat. EVERY oil, (olive, canola, coconut, avocado, etc.) packs a whopping 4,000 calories per pound. Compare that to veggies at 100 calories per pound, or fruits at 300 calories per pound), and you can see how quickly oil can add excess calories without filling you up. Oh and it is not just the calories. Oil is a processed food stripped of fiber, protein and most nutrients. When olives, corn, coconuts, or seeds are pressed into oil, almost everything that made them nourishing is removed. What’s left? Empty calories with a halo of marketing.</p>
                  <p>Interesting fact: It takes approximately 18-20 olives to produce one tablespoon of olive oil.</p>
                  <p className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
        {`Rebel Cheat Sheet: Calories per Pound
        Vegetables                100 calories per pound

        Fruits                         300 calories per pound

        Beans/ Legumes       500-600 calories per pound

        Whole Grains            500-600 calories per pound

        Nuts/seeds                2,500-3,000 calories per pound

                  </p>
                  <p>Eat the olive, not the oil. The olive gives you fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. The oil gives you, OIL. The same goes for corn(corn oil vs. whole corn), coconuts (coconut oil vs. coconut meat), or sunflower seeds (sunflower oil vs. seeds). I think you are getting the message. When you choose the whole food you’re getting the full package of nutrition that nature intended.</p>
                  <p>Even the much praised olive oil is NOT a whole food. It is calorie dense and nutrient poor compared to eating actual olives. For anyone dealing with cholesterol or heart disease, even small amounts of oil can be harmful.</p>
                  <p>The better option? Enjoy healthy sources of whole fats, avocados, seeds, and nuts. If you are watching cholesterol, keep those in check also. For omega 3s, the best WFPB choice is ground flaxseed sprinkled on your meal.</p>

                  <p>Rebellious Aging isn’t about trendy “superfoods.” It is about choosing whole foods that nourish, energize, and keep us sparkling strong. Oil does NOT make the cut because it is calorie dense, nutrient poor, over processed and NOT a whole food.</p>
                  <p>So next time you’re tempted by that shiny bottle, remember: Eat the Olive, not the Oil. Your body (and your sparkle) will thank you.</p>

            Let's be honest: salt has been riding high on its reputation as the magic dust that makes food taste better. It's in shakers on your table, sprinkled across Instagram food shots, and dressed up as "Himalayan pink" or "sea harvested artisan crystals." Very fancy marketing, but let's cut through the hype, Salt is Salt. If you crave vitality, not sluggishness, it is time to ask the tough question, what's all that sprinkling doing to your sparkle?
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>How Much is Enough?</strong><br />
            WHO: &lt;2,000 mg sodium/day<br />
            AHA: Best under 1500 mg/day, max 2,300 mg/day<br />
            WFPB: Skip the shaker, plants will provide all you need.<br />
            The less you shake on, the brighter your health shines.
          </p>

          <p>
            Too much sodium does more than make you thirsty, it raises blood pressure, strains your kidneys, dulls your taste buds, and contributes to stomach cancer risk. Over salting quietly steals your healthspan.
          </p>

          <p>
            So cut back (eliminate added salt) and protect your heart and arteries, give your kidneys a break, retrain your taste buds to savor natural flavors, kick bloating to the curb and add vibrant years to your health span.
          </p>

          <p>
            So let's talk about salt types. Ya know, pink salt, sea salt, Kosher salt, etc. Don't be fooled (for the most part) by marketing sparkle. <strong>Salt is Salt.</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Flavor does not need a shaker.</strong> Use your imagination. Try garlic, onion, ginger, chili flakes. Fresh herbs like basil, cilantro, and mint. Use citrus and vinegars for brightness and nutritional yeast for a savory kick.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>NOTE:</strong> Potassium based salt substitutes exist, but they are not for everyone. (Please check with your doctor before going down this path especially if you have kidney issues or take certain meds).
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Can you get too little salt?</strong> It's rare. Unless you are an extreme athlete sweating buckets, or under medical restriction, your daily plant based meals cover your sodium needs naturally. True deficiency is uncommon.
          </p>

          <p>
            From The National Library of Medicine, the following are some of the vegetables that cover your sodium needs. Celery, chard, olives, beets, seaweed, peas, dry roasted nuts, chick peas, bran, sweet corn, artichoke, broccoli, radish, sweet potato, kale, brussels sprouts…, I think you get the idea. Just eat a variety.

            Critical Thinking is the rebel's power move. It is the ability to pause, question, and separate truth from noise. So instead of blindly accepting what you are told, ask: What's the evidence? Who benefits if I believe this? That is where the freedom and sparkle live.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Mel Robbins says, "Your brain is wired to protect you, not propel you. Brene' Brown adds,"Curiosity is a superpower." Together, they remind us that curiosity and courage are the engines of sharp thinking and vibrant living.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            This is all so empowering to me. How about you?
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Here is how I feel critical thinking fuels my pillars.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Healthspan</strong><br />
            Don't fall for every shiny health fad. Critical thinking leads you back to what is proven. In my case embracing a WFPB lifestyle, daily movement and sustainable choices. (Again let me add here that I am sharing what works for me, maybe it will work for you. I am not here to arm wrestle you to believe what I believe, I am here to share my story and plant a seed.) The rest is up to you. No judgement here at all. YOU DO YOU! Do your own research, figure it out, do not follow blindly. I am sharing great resources to help you find YOUR own way. Oh, and always be ready for adjustments and change. Science is a moving, runaway train, never to be stopped. Stay alert.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Confidence</strong><br />
            Critical thinking is the filter between society's noise and your own truth. That voice whispering, "You're too old. Is it true, or is it cultural conditioning? By questioning limiting beliefs you reclaim your voice and your confidence. Mel Robbins teaches that courage grows through action, but critical thinking tells you what actions matter most. Confidence grows when you can say: "I have examined the options, and I chose what is right for me." Please use critical thinking to cut through limiting beliefs and RECLAIM SELF-TRUST.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Unapologetic Style</strong><br />
            Fashion rules say, dress your age. Rebels say, dress your JOY. Critical thinking gives you the freedom to decide what feels authentic and fabulous. At the least, remember to look your very best every day. "Look your best. Feel your best. Be unstoppable. Because showing up beautifully for yourself is the ultimate act of grace".) Even if it is just you and the dog. Know that critical thinking does not make you cynical. It makes you curious. Big difference. And Curiosity keeps you vibrant, alive, and rebelliously radiant.

    ),
    body: (
      <>

        <div className="prose max-w-none space-y-4 mb-16">
          <p>Did you know that more than HALF of the average American diet comes from ultra-processed food(UPF), (junk food?)</p>

          <p>Here is a solid, evidence-based definition of Ultra-Processed Food from (NOVA) a food classification system often used in nutrition. Ultra- processed foods (UPF's) are industrial formulations made mostly or entirely from substances extracted from foods (oils, fats, sugar, starch proteins, or derived from food constituents (hydrogenated fats, modified starch) or synthesized in laboratories (flavor enhancers, colorings, emulsifiers, preservatives). They contain little or NO intact whole food and are designed to be convenient, hyperpalatable (addictive) and you guessed it, PROFITABLE. As you can see UPF's are not really food, they are chemical formulas. They are created in factories, stuffed with additives, engineered for shelf life and "bliss point" flavor. They are more chemistry than nourishment. Examples: packaged snacks, sodas, instant noodles, frozen dinners, candy bars, flavored yogurts, and processed meats, coffee creamers, alcohol mixers, and many ice cream treats to name a few.</p>

          <p>70-73% of the U.S. food supply is classified as ultra-processed. (Northeastern University Network Science Institute and Food Tank using the same data).</p>

          <p>UPF's make up nearly half of all grocery food purchases, and over ⅓ of beverage purchases. (Global Food Research Program).</p>

          <p>Around 58% of staples in U.S. leading supermarkets are ultra processed, which is higher than a comparable measure in Europe.</p>

          <p>Ultra-processed foods equal 55% of U.S. diets. Kids? 62% (CDC). Here is the kicker: processed food plus animal products equal ZERO FIBER. Fiber is only found in plants and it's your guts best friend.</p>

          <p>Even at home, UPF's are on the rise. Now making up 54% of calories of food consumed at home, while minimally processed foods are steadily declining (Johns Hopkins Public Health).</p>

          <p>While not identical, processed foods and many animal products share traits that work against our health.</p>

          <p>They are high in saturated fat.</p>

          <p>Overly processed.</p>

          <p>Loaded with preservatives and salt.</p>

          <p>Diluted nutrient value.</p>

          <p>Fiber Free</p>

          <p>Both animal products and processed foods completely lack fiber. Fiber is only found in plants and it is essential for gut health, satiety, stable blood sugar and lowering cholesterol.</p>

          <p>Your body is NOT CRAVING additives or flavor enhancers. No it is not. It is asking for Protein from beans, lentils and soy. It loves omega-3 fatty acids (flax, chia and walnuts) to quiet inflammation. Antioxidants from colorful fruits and veggies to fight oxidative stress. Fiber is necessary for gut health and microbiome balance. Read Fiber Fueled by Dr Will Bulsiewicz. theplantfedgut.com. In addition your body needs micronutrients like magnesium, zinc, calcium and vitamins that whole foods deliver naturally.</p>

          <p>Ultra-processed foods often come fortified but that is like "taping the roof back on after a storm. Whole foods provide the full  package your body needs, wants and recognizes and knows how to use.</p>

          <p>Why do processed foods pack on the pounds? You have heard it before: "Calories are calories." Except they are not. A groundbreaking NIH trial (2019) gave participants diets matched for calories, sugar, fat, and fiber. When eating ultraprocessed foods, participants ate 500 more calories per day and gained weight. On unprocessed diets, they lost weight without even trying. Because processed foods are engineered to be hyper-palatable, and easy to overeat, they bypass satiety signals, leaving you hungry for more. On the other hand, whole foods due to the fiber content take longer to chew, digest more slowly and leave you satisfied.</p>

          <p>With processed foods your brain connection is hijacked by Flavor Labs. It is not just your waistline, UPF's target your brain's reward system, lighting up dopamine receptors much like addictive substances are known to do.</p>

          <p>Here at Rebellious Aging we do not just want to live longer, we want to SPARKLE LONGER. Escaping the ultra-processed trap is about reclaiming energy, confidence, and healthspan. It is about eating in a way that helps us move, laugh, and thrive into our 70's, 80's and beyond.</p>

          <p>So my dear Rebel, I suggest  you shop the perimeter of the grocery store (fruits, veggies, grains and legumes). Cook at home, even simple meals can outshine packaged ones.</p>

          <p>Swap an apple for a granola bar, hummus instead of ranch dip, oats instead of a sugary cereal.</p>

          <p>Best to eat whole foods, foods with ingredients you recognize, and remember to read labels.</p>

          <p>Ultra-processed foods may be convenient, but they steal from your health. Whole foods on the other hand give back with energy, and resilience.</p>

          <p>Read, "Ultra-Processed People" by Chris Van Tulleken</p>

          <p>So step out of the trap, Eat Whole, Live Whole.</p>

          <p>Have you ever scrolled through your feed, half distracted, when a phrase suddenly leaps out and grabs you by the collar? That is what happened to me the other day with these four words, "If not now, when?"</p>

          <p>It stopped me cold.</p>

          <p>And then I wondered, how many women are quietly living on autopilot? Autopilot looks safe. Basically you stick with the same foods, the same routines, the same "it is what it is" attitude. You don't rock the boat, you choose not to ruffle the feathers. You accept aches, sluggish mornings, creeping doubts, and an uninspired wardrobe as the way things are.</p>

          <p>But here's the hard truth, autopilot might keep you coasting, and comfortable, and even safe, BUT, it also keeps you stuck.</p>

          <p>In my mind, Rebellious Aging is about refusing to settle for bland, or the "too late for me" story. It is about daring to choose NOW, ME, and an exciting future. (Remember, refuse to let the old lady in).</p>

          <p>Every plant powered meal is a choice for vibrancy tomorrow. Setting boundaries and speaking up builds the muscle of self belief, and choosing color, sparkle and play in how you present yourself shifts your energy and how people see you. This is not about chasing youth. It is about claiming the fullness of life that is still in front of you today.</p>

          <p>One of the greatest lies we tell ourselves is "it is too late." Ya know, too late to change our health, too late to reinvent our style, too late to say NO or YES. But here's the TRUTH. Y'all only ever have one moment to work with. And that moment is NOW. I challenge you to seize this moment, with eyes wide open and begin to make your dreams a reality. One small change at a time.</p>

          <p>Let's explore some ideas. What is one thing you've been putting off because you think it is too late? What tiny step can you take today to improve your health, confidence or style or any dream you are dreaming. (Please email me and let's discuss the possibilities. suz@rebelwithsuz.com).</p>

          <p>WHAT WOULD SHIFT if you stopped waiting and started choosing?</p>

          <p>Motivation is not waiting for the perfect moment, it is created in the moment. By choosing a "spark" today, you create more fuel for tomorrow.</p>

          <p>Check out these resources to help you begin your new adventure.</p>

          <p>BJ Fogg's, Behavior Model (Stanford) behaviormodel.org Motivation + ability + a trigger =action.</p>

          <p>James Clear, Atomic Habits, jamesclear.com  Motivation follows action. Even tiny rebellious steps.</p>

          <p>Deci & Ryan 1985-present. True motivation flourishes when we feel autonomy (choice), competence (capability), and connection (community) selfdeterminationtheory.org.</p>

          <p>Motivation through the Rebellious Aging Lens.</p>

          <p>Intrinsic motion is doing something because it feels good, meaningful or aligns with who you are. For example choosing plants because they give you energy to sparkle.</p>

          <p>Extrinsic motion is doing something for an outside reward or to avoid pain. For example eating well because your doctor said you should.</p>

          <p>Rebellious Aging leans into intrinsic motivation. You know what I mean, right? Finding joy, self expression, and personal rebellion in health, confidence and style. This is what lasts.</p>

          <p>Motivation is the bridge between thinking about change and actually living it. The autopilot way of life feels safe because it requires no motivation but also delivers no sparkle.</p>

          <p>So therefore: Motivation = The Spark Behind Action.</p>

          <p>So ask yourself, "if not now, when?"</p>

          <p>Rebels do not wait for the perfect moment, they create it. They choose plants over autopilot, boldness over complacency, sparkle over safe.</p>

          <p>So take this as your nudge, your reminder, your invitation. Because rebels do not coast. They choose, they sparkle and they thrive.</p>

          <p><strong>NOW IS YOUR MOMENT.</strong></p>

          <p>If you have been following me for a while you know I refuse to age quietly. For me aging is intentional, aging is active, and if you let 'it', downright sparkly. Recently I stumbled on a conversation between journalist Paul Von Zielbauer and Colleen Murphy, author of How We Age. (How We Age on Amazon | Amazon.com® Official Site) Their exchange distilled the science of aging into practical, surprising and sometimes, myth busting tips. To me it felt like a roadmap for rebels who refuse to coast into their later years on autopilot.</p>
          
          <p>The conversation centers around non-negotiables and debunking food myths and concludes with potential new tools. Like EXERCISE IS NOT OPTIONAL, SLEEP is YOUR OVERNIGHT CLEANING CREW and FOOD FADS, MYTHS and TRUTHS and WHAT'S ON THE HORIZON.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Exercise is NOT optional.</strong> It is the #1 longevity tool we have. Colleen Murphy emphasizes strength training. Ya know, push, pull, squat, lift. Muscles do not just move us, they release chemicals that fuel brain health, support mitochondria, and help us stay sharp. Think of every lunge and curl as a deposit in your future vitality bank.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Sleep deprivation doesn't just make us cranky, it DAMAGES THE BRAIN.</strong> During deep sleep, your brain literally takes out the trash, flushing toxins that build up during the day. Most of us need 7-8 hours of sleep (sorry, four hour sleepers, you are rare unicorns). Think of sleep as your overnight spa treatment for both body and brain.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Caloric Restriction (CR).</strong> In lab animals, eating less extends lifespan. But in humans? Murphy calls it "a terrible way to live".</p>
          
          <p><strong>Intermittent Fasting (IF).</strong> Trendy, yes. Effective? The jury is out. While some see benefits, others risk muscle loss. Monitoring what you eat, choosing whole, fiber rich foods, may work just as well without side effects.</p>
          
          <p>How about this: Replace the word Eat with the word NOURISH and see how your perspective changes.</p>
          
          <p>We all want to stay sharp, but Murphy points out that brain games often only make you better at brain games. Doing crosswords helps with crosswords, not necessarily memory. Instead movement, quality sleep and social connection are more powerful protectors against cognitive decline. So don't just exercise your brain, it's much better to exercise your whole body.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Here are some things you might be interested in as the science of aging is buzzing with potential new tools.</strong></p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>GLP-1 drugs, like Ozempic, which are used for diabetes and weight loss, may carry aging benefits also.</li>
            <li>Metformin, the TAME trial is studying the common diabetes drug for its anti aging potential.</li>
            <li>Rapamycin ('Raplogs') may mimic the effects of caloric restriction without the misery.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Instead of chasing pills and potions, we can lean on what Dr. Esselstyn calls the body's "remarkable healing capacity" when fueled by plants. Dr. T. Colin Campbell's research confirms it: whole, plant based foods, regular movement, and restorative sleep do more to protect and energize us than any chemical fix. These simple, powerful and sustainable choices are the real horizon of healthy aging.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Rebel's Guide to Starting Today</strong></p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Add one strength workout per week</li>
            <li>Protect your sleep, treat it like a non-negotiable meeting.</li>
            <li>Eat foods that come from nature, not a factory.</li>
            <li>Stay curious, social, grateful, and joyful.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Colleen Murphy's research confirms what many of us rebels already sense: aging well is not about magic pills or endless deprivation. It is more about AWARENESS, INTENTIONAL daily choices, movement, rest, nourishment, joy and gratefulness. Aging is inevitable.</p>

        <div className="space-y-4 mb-16">
          <p>
            Have you ever felt like managing your weight is a constant uphill climb? Counting calories, measuring portions, avoiding carbs, dodging fats, eliminating sugar. It can be exhausting. The truth is, when you choose the right foods, your body naturally regulates your weight. Good news, right? No more obsessing. No more deprivation. The key is something many people have never heard of: calorie density. What is CALORIE DENSITY, you may ask? Calorie density is simply the number of calories in a given weight of food, usually measured per pound.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Foods with a lower calorie density provide fewer calories for the same volume. This means you can eat until you are satisfied without overeating. (Here lies the beauty of eating plants).
          </p>
          
          <p>
            On average: Vegetables average 100 calories/ lb.<br />
            Fruits average about 300 calories/lb.<br />
            Whole grains & legumes 400-600 calories/lb.<br />
            Animal products and processed 1,200-4,000
          </p>
          
          <div className="my-8 flex justify-center">
            <img 
              src={calorieDensityChart} 
              alt="Calorie density comparison chart showing vegetables at 100 calories per pound, fruits at 300 calories per pound, whole grains at 400-600 calories per pound, and animal products and processed foods at 1,200-4,000 calories per pound"
              className="max-w-full h-auto rounded-lg shadow-md"
            />
          </div>
          
          <p>
            Therefore, the higher the calorie density, the easier it is to take in excess calories long before your body signals fullness.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Whole, plant based foods are naturally low in calorie density. Fill your plate with vegetables and fruits, whole grains, beans, nuts and seeds, and you will feel full before you can overeat.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn who pioneered reversing heart disease with a WFPB diet, often reminds us that: "You can eat all the vegetables, legumes, whole grains and fruits you want until you are comfortably full. There is no calorie counting, no portion control, no hunger."
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Dr. T. Colin Campbell, author of the "China Study", showed through decades of research that populations eating mostly plants had lower rates of obesity and chronic disease. Why? Because their food patterns were low in calorie density and high in nutrition.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Plants include 2 secret weapons missed from meat and processed foods, fiber and water. Fiber slows digestion, stabilizes blood sugar, and sends you the "I am full signal". Water adds bulk without calories, which also aids in digestion. Together water and fiber act like nature's built in portion control.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The power of calorie control is definitely not about restriction, no, it is about freedom. Imagine enjoying big, colorful plates of food, feeling full, and watching your weight settle naturally. That is the JOY of a WFPB lifestyle. You do not have to eat less. You just have to eat differently, PLANTS FOR THE WIN.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Your body will thank you for making the switch, with energy, vitality, and balance that fad diets could never deliver or sustain. Your body finds balance, and you get to enjoy food with freedom.

          <p>
            As we age, exercise stops being about burning calories and becomes about building confidence, balance, and health span.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I have read it in countless studies, and I have lived it in my own body. Strength and balance training are not just important, they are essential.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            After 50, our muscles start whispering reminders that they need attention. Every decade we lose roughly 3-5% of muscle mass unless we deliberately work to keep it. That loss shows up as less energy, slower metabolism, and a greater risk of falling.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            But the good news? It can be reversible. Lifting weights, even light ones, signals to your body, "I still need this strength!" Strength training protects bones, boosts metabolism, and supports posture. This is not about sculpting. It is about staying independent, capable, and vibrant.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The power of balance is one of the first things we lose as we age, yet it is the key to moving confidently through life. I try to weave balance work into my day, not just while I am working out. (Yoga poses and brushing my teeth balancing on one foot and walking in a straight line toe to heel, heel to toe while standing erect).
          </p>
          
          <p>
            A strong core and steady footing keep us upright, but balance also teaches patience and presence. It reminds us that aging gracefully is not about standing still; it is about staying centered and grounded while life moves around us.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Walking is simple, steady, and transformational. Besides strength training and yoga three times a week, I walk 2-3 miles every day. More on the weekends. Walking clears my head, connects me with nature, and gently strengthens my heart and legs. It is an easy and simple form of movement, but it delivers so much: better circulation, sharper mood, steadier sleep.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            If I could give one piece of advice to anyone 55+ it would be this: <strong>NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF A DAILY WALK.</strong> Even a few blocks count. The goal is not speed or distance; it is consistency. Start slow and watch yourself get strong.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Stretching is underrated. However it is what keeps us supple and pain free. It is also one of the kindest things you can do for yourself. Five minutes of stretching is so rewarding and beneficial. You will see and feel your progress in days. There are so many great stretches. The best are the ones you will do. Remember it is not about flexibility; it is about fluidity.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I like schedules. They keep me honest. For me working out is self care in the best form and non-negotiable. The best form of exercise is the one you will do. Just keep moving. The secret again is consistency. Movement, in any form, should be non-negotiable, like brushing your teeth or saying thank you.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            All too often we have grown to think of working out as a chore or worse punishment, or as a form of guilt. But movement is not punishment. It is gratitude in motion.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            So move however you can. Stretch if you cannot walk. Walk if you cannot lift. Whatever you do, keep moving. Motion keeps us in touch with vitality and vitality is what keeps us rebellious.

            Some people want us to believe that after a certain age, women simply fade into the background. That attractiveness is a function of fertility. Wait a second!
          </p>

          <p>
            Here is the truth: Women are only invisible if they want to be.
          </p>

          <p>
            Do not let a myth, not grounded in fact, change who you think you are. Perhaps we are in the midst of a shift. I hope so. Because as we get older we actually have more space, more time, clarity, and freedom to focus on our style, our personal look.
          </p>

          <p>
            Never take this lightly. How you present is important. It is your calling card. The most important person it should be important to is YOU. Be your best and look your best every single day. You will reap unimaginable benefits and rewards.
          </p>

          <p>
            Know your style. Know the difference between what you are attracted to or find attractive on others and what looks good on you. There is a big difference between these. Do not be afraid to step it up if you like. Why not? This is your time to shine bright. The beauty of aging rebelliously is that the rules no longer apply. You get to write your own now.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ignore fast fashion, mostly. Those toss away pieces? They are not your friends. Instead, interpret fashion individually, for your taste, your body, and your comfort. Ask: am I purchasing something I love, that will look good on my fabulous body? Or am I buying a style I love but will not love me back?
          </p>

          <p>
            Keep it simple. Invest in pieces with attention to cut and detail. Purchase only items that flatter YOU. Buy items that will still feel fabulous season after season.
          </p>

          <p>
            How about a challenge? Pause new purchases for six months. It will be a relief, I promise you. Have fun playing in your closet. Pretend it is a store and you are putting outfits together for display. Figure out what you wear the most. Pay attention, take notes, and get a donate bag at the ready. Be ruthless. By the end you will have a solid overview of what you truly love, a cleaned out and tidy closet, and more importantly the style or styles that work for you. Now you will be ready to shop with clarity and discernment.
          </p>

          <p>
            You will now move from spontaneous buying and short lived adornments to deliberate, meaningful choices. When you begin to buy well, and combine the best of today with exquisite vintage or thoughtfully chosen pieces, you will create a personalized wardrobe full of meaning and memory.
          </p>

            a new headline claiming to have the “secret” to health or the final word on nutrition. Scroll long enough and
            you will meet passionate experts, charismatic influencers, and “data-driven” gurus all shouting their own truth.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some mean well. Others have something to sell. Sadly, a few are simply dangerous. Even respected institutions can
            lose sight of objectivity because money, power, and prestige can and will complicate pure science. Truly, it is not
            easy to know what—or who—to believe. Most people do not have the time or inclination to dig into the research behind
            the research. Following the money helps, but even that can get tricky. So I approach most things with curiosity and,
            yes, a pinch of skepticism. We all need to get better at this.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over the years I have dug deep and feel comfortable following two of the greats in the plant movement:
            <strong> Dr. T. Colin Campbell</strong> from Cornell University and founder of The Center for Nutrition Studies, and
            <strong> Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn</strong> from the Cleveland Clinic and author of <em>Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease</em>.
            These two “oldies but goodies” are in their 90s, still writing, researching, and thriving. Their families have lived a
            Whole Food Plant Based (WFPB) lifestyle for 55+ years, grounded in evidence—not hype.
          </p>

          <p>
            That being said, I continue to pay attention to as many legitimate physicians and researchers as I can. Following a
            WFPB lifestyle has served me well—that is that. My goal is not to convert or convince but to create awareness.
            This is why “Health” is the very first pillar of Rebellious Aging. I have witnessed transformation in myself and in
            others, and I simply want people to know this path exists, even if it feels too big a change right now.
          </p>

          <p>
            Please do not ever follow blindly. I will continue to give you resources and references. Be the CEO of your own health.
            Ask questions. Stay curious. Be open, but remain a bit skeptical. That is the rebel way.

            Every now and then an article comes along that clicks. When I read Farley Ledgerwood’s piece on aging gracefully, I
            felt an instant yes—an emphatic share. It echoed what I believe deep down: aging is not fading away. It is stepping
            into who we really are. Graceful? Maybe. But for rebels like us, it is about doing it boldly, consciously, and with
            sparkle.

            What Graceful Aging Really Means: 6 Things to Stop Doing by 60
          </p>

          <p>
            Aging is not a slow fade. It is a bold, brightly lit shift. Loving our next decades means letting go of what no longer
            serves us. Start here:
          </p>

          <div className="space-y-3">
            <p>
              <strong>1. Stop treating movement as optional.</strong><br />
              Move because you love how alive you feel after. Walk, stretch, play tug with your pup, or dance the polka around your
              living room. Motion is a celebration, not a punishment.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>2. Stop eating like you are 25.</strong><br />
              That metabolism is history. Nourishment matters more than ever. Embrace vibrant, Whole Food, Plant Based choices.
              Let your plate reflect your dignity and your delight.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>3. Stop bottling up emotions.</strong><br />
              Holding back hurts. Sleep, spirit, and grace all suffer. Journal. Talk. Release. Let your inner world be heard,
              soothed, and aligned with who you are now.
            </p>

            <p className="italic">
              “Aging is not a retreat, it’s a reveal!”
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>4. Stop saying yes when you mean no.</strong><br />
              Your time and energy are sacred. Guard your calendar. Say no kindly but firmly when something does not light you up.
              Make space for what does.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>5. Stop comparing your timeline to everyone else’s.</strong><br />
              Comparison steals your momentum. Your path is your own. Measure progress against yesterday, not someone else’s
              highlight reel.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>6. Stop clinging to grudges and regrets.</strong><br />
              Emotional weight slows you down. Forgiveness frees your future self. Clean out the attic of your heart and lean into
              what’s ahead.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Pick one habit this week and begin there. Small steps compound into confidence. When you move, eat, feel, say yes to
            YOU, and let go—you are not aging. You are arriving.

          <p>
            We have long been told that if our waistlines expand, the culprit is willpower or personal discipline. A growing body
            of research invites a more compassionate—and accurate—view: the broader food environment is playing a much larger role
            than we have been led to believe.
          </p>

          <p>
            In a recent CNN piece, nutrition scientist Kevin Hall, PhD (author of <em>Food Intelligence</em>), argues that it is
            time to stop the self-blame and start looking outward. The food system itself is designed in ways that promote excess.
          </p>

          <p className="font-semibold">Kevin Hall’s key takeaways:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Genetics influence body size, but they have not changed much in decades, while obesity rates have skyrocketed.</li>
            <li>The modern food system creates a calorie glut, converting vast surpluses of corn, soy, wheat, and rice into ultra-processed foods (UPFs).</li>
            <li>UPFs are engineered for taste, convenience, and profit—high calorie, low satiety, hyper-palatable, and addictive.</li>
            <li>Hall’s studies show that people consume hundreds more calories per day when their diets are heavy in UPFs, even when nutrient profiles match.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            So, it is not simply “eat less and move more.” Our environment makes overeating easy and resisting incredibly difficult.
            Let’s shift from shame to strategy, advocate for better food access, make small daily changes, and extend grace to ourselves.
          </p>

          <p className="font-semibold">A few practical tips:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Scan your food environment and notice which choices are quietly undermining your health.</li>
            <li>Choose more whole foods when possible—fill your plate with ingredients you recognize.</li>
            <li>Read labels. If it sounds like a lab experiment, it probably behaves like one inside your body.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If you have been blaming yourself for your waistline, stop. The system is stacked against us—but awareness gives us
            power. Choose wisely, kindly, and strategically, and remember to sparkle on.

          <p>
            We have all seen the headlines promising a “miracle weight loss diet” or a “magic fix.” But the truth? Most weight loss
            plans leave you tired, hungry, and drained of joy—the very opposite of sparkle.
          </p>

          <p>
            A Whole Food Plant Based (WFPB) lifestyle turns that story on its head. Eating plants is definitely not about restriction
            or guilt. Nope! It is about abundance: colorful plates, delicious meals, steady energy, and a renewed sense of confidence
            in your body.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is NOT a diet. It is a return to the way our bodies were designed to thrive. A WFPB approach focuses on eating foods
            as close to their natural form as possible—vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, lentils, nuts, and seeds—while letting
            go of animal products (cheers for the animals) and ultra-processed foods.
          </p>

          <p>Here is the secret: this is not about what you give up. It is about what you gain.</p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>You gain energy</strong> because your body runs beautifully on nutrient-rich, fiber-filled foods.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>You gain freedom</strong> because there is no calorie counting or endless tracking. Enjoy until you are comfortably full.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>You gain peace of mind</strong> knowing you are caring for your body, the animals, the planet, and your future self.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Science backs this up. Study after study shows people following WFPB lifestyles lose more weight than those on deficit,
            restrictive, or low-carb plans—and they keep it off. Why? Because the food is naturally low in calorie density but rich in
            fiber and nutrients.
          </p>

          <p>Weight loss is yet another bonus of eating WFPB. How, you ask?</p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>It fills you up, not out.</strong> Fiber, only found in plants, slows digestion, stabilizes blood sugar, and keeps you satisfied longer.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>It is nutrient dense, not calorie dense.</strong> A baked potato and a handful of chips come from the same plant, but only one nourishes you.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>It supports your metabolism.</strong> Plant-based diets improve insulin sensitivity and lower inflammation—two keys to unlocking your body’s natural fat-burning rhythm.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>It changes your relationship with food.</strong> Once you begin eating for nourishment and vitality, “dieting” feels outdated. WFPB living brings back joy, taste, and freedom.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            As we age, metabolism shifts, hormones change, and muscle mass declines. That does not mean we are doomed to gain weight—it
            means we must fuel wisely. WFPB living helps counter those changes. Antioxidants and phytonutrients support hormones,
            reduce inflammation, and keep us glowing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Weight loss does not need to feel like deprivation. It can be a celebration of health, freedom, and joy. A WFPB lifestyle
            lets you lose weight naturally while gaining energy, confidence, vibrancy, and improved health.
          </p>

          <p>
            WFPB eating is not about counting calories. It is about counting on yourself to make choices that honor the beautiful,
            confident, authentic woman you are. Every colorful meal, every extra serving of greens, every moment you choose plants over
            animals and ultra-processed foods is a quiet act of rebellion against the myths of dieting and aging.

            Retirement carries a shimmering promise of free time and fresh adventures, yet it can also stir up foggier emotions:
            “Who will I be without my title?” “What will my days look like?” Today I want to offer a gentle map so you can step
            toward this milestone with curiosity, confidence, and plenty of sparkle.
          </p>

          <p>
            Think of this as a guided tour: what retirement feels like at first glance, how to prepare beyond the financials,
            the sobering statistics we cannot ignore, practical ways to thrive (not just survive), and what I—at 83—am learning
            about rewriting work on my own terms.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10">1. Retirement at First Glance</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Relief &amp; Freedom:</strong> After decades of responsibility, you finally have permission to slow down,
              choose, and explore. That feels delicious.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Loss of Structure or Identity:</strong> If your work defined you (and for many of us it did), stepping away can
              feel like a giant blank space. It is common to ask, “Who am I now?”
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mixed Emotions:</strong> Joy, uncertainty, financial questions, purpose questions—they can all coexist. Nothing
              has gone wrong; it simply means you care about this next season.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10">2. Retirement Prep Matters</h2>
          <p>
            Retirement should feel like stepping onto a new plateau, not falling off a cliff. Dialing in logistics (finances, health)
            is essential, but so is tending to the emotional and mental landscape (meaning, structure, identity). Begin well before
            your final office party so you have time to experiment.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Reinvention:</strong> Consider retirement a launchpad for passion projects, volunteering, travel, or deeper
              family life.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Social Shifts:</strong> Work brings built-in community; leaving means creating new rhythms of connection.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Nibble · Wiggle · Dazzle Philosophy:</strong> Ease into change, experiment, and remember there is always
              room to sparkle—at every stage.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10">3. Sobering Statistics</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              Only <strong>11%</strong> of financial planners say their clients are emotionally prepared for retirement—even when the
              money side looks good (Financial Planning Association, 2025).
            </li>
            <li>
              Just <strong>35%</strong> of non-retirees feel their savings are on track (Pension Consultants, 2025).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>20%</strong> of Americans 50+ have zero retirement savings, and <strong>61%</strong> worry they will not have
              enough (AARP, 2024).
            </li>
            <li>
              Around <strong>60%</strong> of retirees feel comfortable relying on Social Security alone, yet most non-retirees do not
              expect that comfort (Gallup, 2024).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10">4. Practical Ways to Retire (Not Just Financially)</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Reflect on Identity:</strong> Ask, “What gave me joy at work? How can I translate that feeling now?”
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Design an Ideal Day:</strong> Map movement, meals, creativity, connection, and rest.

            <li>
              <strong>Do a Financial Reality Check:</strong> Know your numbers, get advice, and adjust lifestyle expectations early.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Plan for Health &amp; Activity:</strong> Stay moving, stay curious, and stay socially engaged.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Experiment Now:</strong> Try phased retirement, part-time work, or new hobbies while you still have a familiar
              scaffold underneath you.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Stay Flexible:</strong> Desires evolve; let curiosity be your compass.

          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10">5. What I Am Learning</h2>
          <p>
            At 83, I am not fading out—I am focusing in. I still coach, mentor, consult, and shout about Whole Food Plant Based living.
            I launched Rebellious Aging, built this very website, and opened a private Facebook group for fellow rebels. Retirement, for
            me, is permission to prioritize the work that matters most.
          </p>
          <p>
            Retirement is not the end of relevance; it is the beginning of intentional impact. Gratitude, health, courage, and community
            keep the spark alive.
          </p>

          <p className="text-xl font-semibold mt-10">The Wrap Up</p>
          <p>
            Retirement is not an exit—it is a doorway. With preparation, curiosity, and courage, you can walk through it with a bounce
            in your step, vibrant health, and authentic confidence. If you need a companion read, I recommend{' '}

          <p>
            If there’s one thing I have learned in decades of living, reading, researching, cooking, and experimenting, it’s this:
            plants do not disappoint.
          </p>

          <p>
            They are honest, authentic, and humble. They show up as they are—vibrant, colorful, and full of life to share—and they ask
            so little in return. Give them sun, water, care, and love and they reward you tenfold. When we invite them into our
            kitchens and onto our plates, they nourish, restore, and energize without conditions.
          </p>

          <p>I have never heard a head of kale make false promises. I have never seen an apple hide fine print. Plants simply support life.</p>

          <p>
            Nutrition science evolves constantly, but one truth stays steady: the more plants we eat, the better we do. Study after
            study shows that diets rich in whole, unprocessed plant foods reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes, autoimmune
            disease, and even depression. No hype. No drama. Just nature doing its quiet, dependable work.
          </p>

          <p>
            And here is the beautiful thing: plants don’t judge. They don’t care if you’re 25 or 85, a gourmet cook, or someone who can
            barely boil water. They meet you where you are and, without hesitation, begin transforming you from the inside out, one
            bite at a time.
          </p>

          <p>
            We live in a world full of letdowns, quick fixes that don’t fix, products that overpromise, and food that pretends to
            nourish while slowly draining our vitality.
          </p>

          <p>
            Every time I slice open a ripe tomato, watch a handful of spinach wilt in a pan, or bite into a juicy apple, I am reminded
            that nature doesn’t need a marketing campaign. Nature can school us all on how to deliver.
          </p>

          <p>
            Of course plants will not always be perfect—sometimes they are misshapen or a little bruised—but they are real, they are
            alive, and they keep their promises.
          </p>

          <p>
            So here is my thing: I will keep sharing what I have learned about the Whole Food Plant Based lifestyle. Not to convince or
            convert you, but to show what is possible when we trust the simple, honest gifts that nature gives us.
          </p>

          <p>
            You do not need to overhaul your life overnight. Just start. Invite more plants to your table and replace the word “EAT”
            with “NOURISH” to see how your perspective changes.
          </p>

          <p>The plants you invite in will:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Show up</li>
            <li>Heal</li>
            <li>Not disappoint.</li>
          </ul>

        <div className="prose max-w-none space-y-4 mb-16">

          <p>
            Let’s be honest—the older we get, the easier it is to think about moving instead of actually doing it. But here is the
            truth I have learned over a lifetime of experiments, injuries, routines, and reboots: MOTION IS NON NEGOTIABLE.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our bodies are designed to move. Movement keeps joints lubricated, minds sharp, moods steady, and bones strong. Yet for
            many women of “a certain age,” movement becomes optional because we are busy, distracted, or simply unaware of the benefits.
          </p>

          <p>I say NO. Movement is NOT optional. It is essential self-care.</p>

          <p>
            I have been moving one way or another since 1979—the year I trained for and finished the Paul Mason Marathon in Saratoga,
            California. It was exhilarating, exhausting, enlightening, and the moment I knew running was “one and done.”
          </p>

          <p>But the habit of moving stuck.</p>

          <p>
            For eight wonderful years I traded running for road biking. I rode 20 miles a day for training and stretched to 25–60 mile
            rides on the weekends. Freedom on two wheels! Then in 2010 everything changed when my husband had a life-altering cycling
            accident. I hung up my helmet and never looked back.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today I walk 2–3 miles every day with my sidekick Gabe. Three times a week—Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday—I lift weights,
            work on balance, stretch, and practice yoga. These routines are my non-negotiables. My happy time. My me time.
          </p>

          <p>It is not just about working out. It is about showing up for myself.</p>

          <p>The science is clear, and the evidence keeps growing:</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Strength training</strong> maintains muscle mass, bone density, and metabolism. It is the best defense against
            frailty and falls.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Walking</strong> improves heart health, brain function, and mood. Thirty minutes a day can lower dementia risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Stretching and balance</strong> preserve flexibility and confidence so we can keep doing what we love—gracefully.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Consistency beats intensity.</strong> Three steady days a week can change your life more than sporadic bursts.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond science, movement reminds us that we are alive. It connects us to our bodies, these incredible vessels that have
            carried us through decades of living.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here is the secret: do not make it complicated. Make it automatic. Treat your movement routine like brushing your teeth—it
            is simply what you do.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold mt-8">Start Here</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Stretch every morning. Before coffee, reach, twist, bend, and breathe for two minutes.</li>
            <li>Walk daily. Around the block, to the mailbox, with a friend, with your dog—rain just means grab an umbrella.</li>
            <li>Add balance work. Stand on one leg for a minute or heel-to-toe walk across the room.</li>
            <li>Lift something. Groceries, soup cans, hand weights—it all builds strength.</li>
            <li>Schedule movement like an appointment and protect it fiercely.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The magic happens when you stop negotiating with yourself. Movement does not need special equipment or fancy outfits. It
            just needs you willing to move. Hop out of bed, lie down on the floor, stretch, and get up to practice that balance work.
          </p>

          <p>
            You have got this. Remember, the best exercise for you is the one you will do. Extra points if you polka around your living
            room—just move, have fun, and do it!

          <p>Walk across the room placing each heel directly in front of the opposite toe like you are on a balance beam.</p>

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold">Day 3 · Weight Shifting</p>
          <p>Shift your weight side-to-side for one or two minutes, feeling your feet anchor into the floor.</p>

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold">Day 4 · Slow Motion Walking</p>
          <p>Take 10 slow steps forward, lifting and placing each foot with intention.</p>

            If you ever wondered why sticking to healthy habits feels so hard, especially in a world packed with shiny
            packages and drive-through temptations, you must read Dr. Doug Lisle’s book <em>The Pleasure Trap</em>. He is the
            staff psychologist and director of research at TrueNorth, and he just may have the answer that will surprise you.
          </p>

          <p>
            One thing is for sure: it is not you. It is biology. It is the environment. And it is the way the two collide.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lisle explains that we are wired with three ancient instincts:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Seek maximum pleasure.</li>
            <li>Avoid pain.</li>
            <li>Conserve energy.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            These instincts helped us survive scarcity. Today? They get hijacked.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold">The Modern World Sets the Trap</p>
          <p>
            Highly processed foods, sugary treats, salty snacks, and anything engineered for a “bliss point” send dopamine
            skyrocketing far beyond what nature intended. Suddenly, natural foods taste bland, cravings feel overpowering,
            and the saddest part is we blame ourselves for lacking willpower. We have all been there, and Lisle’s message is
            powerful: you are not weak—you are responding normally to an abnormal environment.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold">The Three Pleasure Traps</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Hyper-Processed Foods:</strong> Designed to overstimulate the brain’s reward system and make whole foods seem
              boring until you reset your palate.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Sedentary Living:</strong> Our brains adore conserving energy, and modern life makes stillness the path of least
              resistance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Stimulation Everywhere:</strong> Screens, sugar, caffeine, and convenience deliver a daily dopamine overload that
              becomes the default.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            According to Lisle and his co-author Dr. Alan Goldhamer, founder of{' '}
            <a href="https://www.healthpromoting.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-primary hover:underline">
              TrueNorth Health
            </a>, the answer is not judgment, shame, or white-knuckled willpower. It is about creating an environment where
            healthy choices are the simple choices. Shift to whole natural foods (give your taste buds time to recalibrate),
            build simple routines, make temptations harder to access, move your body, and trust your brain to rediscover true
            pleasure.
          </p>

          <p>
            The good news? Once you recognize the trap, no matter your age, you can step out of it. Stepping out means more energy,
            fewer cravings, easier weight control, clearer thinking, more joy in motion, and a deep sense of personal power. This is
            the heart of Rebellious Aging. You are never too old to reclaim your spark, and the sooner the better.
          </p>

          <p>
            Know this and believe it: the pleasure trap is not a life sentence. It is a sneaky detour. Your biology is brilliant, not
            broken. When you feed it whole foods, movement, and a calmer pace, it shines—and you do too.

            is packed with Dr. Greger’s research on B12, and it completely shifted how I view this “little” vitamin.
          </p>

          <p>
            Deficiency symptoms often mimic what society labels as “normal aging.” Do not overlook lingering fatigue, brain fog,
            tingling, or memory slips. They are whispers that your body needs help.
          </p>

          <p>
            We need to supplement—especially on a predominantly plant-based diet. Dr. Greger calls this non-negotiable by age 50, and
            if you are plant-based, start now regardless of age.
          </p>

          <p>
            Why supplement? B12 is made by bacteria, not animals. Historically, humans ingested it from soil and water. Our modern,
            sanitized world removed those natural sources. As Greger says, “Modern life is too clean to rely on nature for B12.”
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold">Good to Know</p>
          <p>
            After age 50, stomach acid often declines, making it harder to extract B12 from food—even animal sources. Older adults are
            at higher risk regardless of diet. Dr. Greger recommends cyanocobalamin because it is stable, effective, well-studied, and
            affordable.

          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Serum Vitamin B12:</strong> The most common test and an okay starting point, but not the most accurate. You can have
              normal blood levels and still be deficient, especially if you are older, vegan, or have digestive issues.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Methylmalonic Acid (MMA):</strong> The gold standard. It shows whether your cells are actually getting enough B12
              and catches deficiencies even when serum levels look normal.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Homocysteine (HCY):</strong> Helpful as supporting data but not as specific as MMA.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold">How Often Should You Get Tested?</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              If you are supplementing consistently, test every 1–2 years.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are not supplementing, do it ASAP.
            </li>
            <li>
              If symptoms appear—fatigue, numbness, tingling, memory changes—test immediately.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Wrap Up: one little tablet, big peace of mind. B12 deficiency is common, preventable, and easy to correct. A small
            supplement can boost energy, protect your brain, support your nerves, and help you stay vibrant, curious, and confident.
            That is Rebellious Aging.

          <p>
            If there is one myth women 55+ are breaking, it is the idea that we must push harder every day to stay stronger. “No pain,
            no gain”? Yikes. No thank you. Rest does not mean you are slacking; it means you are being smart.
          </p>

          <p>
            I walk 2–3 miles every weekday and 4–5 miles on weekends. I lift weights, practice balance, stretch, and treat exercise as
            non-negotiable. And here is what I know to be true: you cannot build strength without rest. You cannot gain balance without
            recovery. You cannot glow if you are always depleted. Your body needs a break. Rest days keep the excitement alive and
            prevent overdoing it.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold">Why Rest Days Matter—Especially After 55</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Muscles repair during rest, not during workouts.</li>
            <li>Rest keeps your hormones happy.</li>
            <li>Rest prevents injury.</li>
            <li>Rest improves balance and coordination.</li>
            <li>Rest boosts motivation and excitement.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            When it comes to exercise, more is not always better. Your body and mind need time to recover.
          </p>

          <p>
            Rest-day possibilities? Light walking, gentle stretching, slow yoga, outdoor time, reading, journaling—you get the idea.

            I was sitting quietly watching the news, when a TV ad from the American Cancer Society nearly knocked me off my chair. It
            got my attention for sure.
          </p>

          <p>Are you READY? "Every 15 seconds, someone in the United States is diagnosed with cancer."</p>

          <p>
            Fifteen seconds? I actually said it out loud to Gabe. Ya know, one Mississippi, two Mississippi... Yikes. By 15
            Mississippi, someone's life is changed forever.
          </p>

          <p>
            Honestly? It terrified me. Not because I live in fear, but because it hit me how urgently we need to take care of the one
            body we get. How much power we actually have. And how often we underestimate it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Upon further glance, the American Cancer Society estimates over 2 million new cancer diagnoses in 2025 in the United
            States. When you do the math, that truly is one diagnosis roughly every 15-16 seconds.
          </p>

          <p>For my friends and readers in Canada, the numbers are no gentler. In 2024 a new cancer diagnosis occurred about every 2 minutes.</p>

          <p>The good news? Aging does not have to mean becoming passive participants in our own decline.</p>

          <p>
            Lifestyle, especially what we eat, plays a powerful role in shaping our long-term risk. No guarantees. Not magic. But
            influence. And influence is enough to change the trajectory of life.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold">Ultra Processed Foods, Our Modern TRAP</p>
          <p>UPFs are your packaged snacks, instant meals, sugary drinks, fast foods - the things engineered to sit on a shelf longer than your houseplants.</p>

          <p>
            Studies have linked high UPF consumption to increased risk of several cancers, including breast, colorectal, and ovarian.
            One major review found that just a 10% increase in UPF intake was associated with a 13% higher risk of all cancers. And
            here is the kicker: UPFs push out the foods that protect us.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold">Why the Whole Food Plant Based Lifestyle Matters, Especially Now!</p>
          <p>A WFPB lifestyle is not about perfection. It is about crowdsourcing nutrients from nature instead of factories.</p>

          <p>The evidence consistently shows that WFPB diets:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Lower inflammation</li>
            <li>Strengthen the immune system</li>
            <li>Support healthier weight</li>
            <li>Improve gut health</li>
            <li>Increase fiber intake</li>
            <li>Deliver antioxidants that help protect cells</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The message is clear: crowd out UPFs by adding more colorful, beautiful plants. Add movement to help keep your hormones
            balanced, decrease inflammation, and support weight stability.
          </p>

          <p>SEE. YOU ARE NOT POWERLESS. NOT EVEN CLOSE.</p>

          <p>Cancer is complex.</p>
          <p>Genetics matter.</p>
          <p>Environment matters.</p>
          <p>Random chance is real.</p>

          <p>
            But lifestyle, especially food, is one of the pieces we can choose. For women 55-105, choosing plants, movement, vibrancy,
            confidence, and gratefulness is not just prevention; it is a declaration:
          </p>

          <p>"I am aging with intention."</p>
          <p>"I am aging with power."</p>
          <p>"Watch me ROAR."</p>

          <p>Why not take a gentle, curious look at your plate today? Start there. No perfection. Only progress.</p>

          <p>You have got this.</p>

        <div className="prose max-w-none space-y-4 mb-16">
          <p>
            I recently heard Dr. Brooke Goldner on Instagram say something so simple, so clear, so piercingly true that I stopped
            scrolling and just sat with it.
          </p>

          <p>"Results are about consistency."</p>

          <p>SO:</p>
          <p>Not intensity.</p>
          <p>Not perfection.</p>
          <p>Not grand plans.</p>

          <p>Consistency.</p>

          <p>One sentence, one special word and it lit me up.</p>

          <p>
            We spend so much time trying to "get motivated", "get disciplined", or "get back on track" when the real transformation
            comes from the quiet little actions we take again and again. It is the small choices that can change a life. Especially
            after 55.
          </p>

          <p>Consistency is the quiet hero.</p>

          <p>Consistency does not make big promises.</p>

          <p>It does not brag.</p>

          <p>It does not show up with fireworks and a marching band.</p>

          <p>But here is the thing: it works every time.</p>

          <p>It works in the kitchen.</p>

          <p>It works in your muscles.</p>

          <p>It works in your mindset.</p>

          <p>It works on your confidence.</p>

          <p>It works for your health.</p>

          <p>Consistency is the friend who whispers, "Let's try again tomorrow." And that whisper holds more power than any motivational speech.</p>

          <p>
            We often think transformation requires big moves, dramatic overhauls, and massive effort. But that is not how real humans,
            especially real, grown, wise, seasoned humans, change.
          </p>

          <p>Transformation happens when you decide to:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Walk every morning even when you do not feel like it.</li>
            <li>Add one more whole plant to your plate.</li>
            <li>Stretch for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drink water before coffee.</li>
            <li>Put on that fabulous, special outfit that makes you feel alive.</li>
            <li>Choose compassion over criticism.</li>
            <li>Practice gratitude, not perfection.</li>
            <li>Keep your promises to yourself.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The small things done repeatedly matter more than the big things done occasionally. It is the daily drip that fills the well.</p>

          <p>
            The world tells older women to slow down. To fade out. To become invisible. To quiet down. But we, the Rebels, know the
            truth. Aging with good health, great confidence, style, and gratitude is an intentional choice.
          </p>

          <p>One walk at a time.</p>

          <p>One nourishing meal at a time.</p>

          <p>One thought at a time.</p>

          <p>One sparkle at a time.</p>

          <p>
            You do not have to overhaul your life. You just have to keep showing up for yourself every single day, believing that only
            you can influence the world in your own special way and that you are worth showing up for.
          </p>

          <p>
            Adopting a whole food plant based lifestyle is not a one day event. It is a gentle pattern. A consistent rhythm. A way of
            saying "I honor my body by nourishing it well".
          </p>

          <p>You do not need daily hour long workouts or perfect splits. You just need movement. Daily movement.</p>

          <p>Style becomes effortless when it reflects who you are consistently.</p>

          <p>Confidence grows when you show up as your authentic self.</p>

          <p>Self-respect deepens when you consistently choose YOU.</p>

          <p>Dazzle is not an outfit. It is a daily practice.</p>

          <p>
            As for me: I walk Gabe daily pushing for 10,000 steps. I lift, stretch, and work on balance 3x a week. Not because I am so
            disciplined but because it keeps me alive, vibrant, strong, and sane. These things are non-negotiable because they create
            the Rebel I want to be. I did not get here overnight. Consistency brought me here gently day by day. And consistency will
            carry me forward.
          </p>

          <p>A message for each of you here at Rebellious Aging:</p>
          <p>You do not need perfection.</p>
          <p>You do not need to be younger.</p>
          <p>You do not need to be faster.</p>
          <p>You do not need to be anyone other than who you are.</p>

          <p>You just need to keep taking the next small step to get you where you dream to be.</p>

          <p>
            Whatever you dream of - better health, stronger confidence, a plant powered life, style that sparks joy, boundaries that
            protect your heart - it will come from consistency. Not from pressure. Not guilt. But the quiet magic of showing up for
            yourself.
          </p>

          <p>So today choose one small thing that you would like to become a big thing and do it again tomorrow. And the next day. And the next day.</p>

          <p>Let consistency shape your glow, your health, your power, and your life.</p>

          <p>You have got this,</p>

          <p>For nine years now, I have lived alone with my best pal Gabe.</p>

          <p>
            Nine years of building, creating, learning, supporting others, coaching, moderating, writing, dreaming and pouring my heart into
            Rebellious Aging, Whole Communities, my website and everything in between.
          </p>

          <p>And for nine years my weekends have looked exactly like my weekdays. YIKES!</p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Work.</li>
            <li>Thinking about work.</li>

            <li>Creating more work.</li>
            <li>Reading stuff relating to work.</li>
            <li>Dreaming up new ideas.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Weekends were just an extension of effort. A chance to finally "get caught up." A place where I folded more tasks into every
            spare corner, telling myself this was all a "good thing".
          </p>

          <p>
            Recently, something shifted. Not wholly in my mind, but also in my body. My body began whispering to me. Then nudging. Then
            finally saying, "Enough. This pace is no longer serving you." And for the first time, in a long time, I listened.
          </p>

          <p>The epiphany that happened on Saturday morning. It started simply.</p>

          <p>
            A quiet Saturday morning. Me, half-awake. No obligations. No deadlines. No events. And a voice inside me, gentle but firm, said:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>"Why don't you sleep in?"</li>
            <li>"Why don't you take an extended hike with Gabe today, it is a gorgeous day?"</li>
            <li>"Why don't you call the "Street Ladies" and go to dinner in town?"</li>
            <li>"Why don't you relax and enjoy what you have accomplished?"</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If you have known me long enough you know I AM QUITE WEARY OF THE VOICE IN MY HEAD. I ONCE READ THAT THE "VOICE" IS FOR
            SURVIVAL NOT HAPPINESS. WOW! This voice I was hearing as I lay in my bed was not laziness, or quitting. The voice was wisdom.
            Perhaps a wisdom that has been maturing in me for decades and was finally ready to be heard.
          </p>

          <p>My body wasn't breaking down, IT WAS WAKING UP!</p>

          <p>
            The truth? My body was not tired. Nope! It was tired of being ignored. Every bit of resistance, every ounce of weekend
            unmotivation wasn't failure, it was information. My body wasn't saying "STOP." It was saying:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>"Choose differently."</li>
            <li>"Honor yourself."</li>
            <li>"Make space for joy."</li>
            <li>"Let yourself live."</li>
          </ul>

          <p>And SO I DID.</p>

          <p>
            This is all new to me and I am treading lightly. Over the last few weekends, I have been experimenting, playing, and
            learning what it means to reclaim Saturdays and Sundays. Not as catch up zones but as SACRED TIME. And oh what joy I have
            found.
          </p>

          <p>Here is what my weekends look like now (two weekends in):</p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Sleeping in without guilt.</li>
            <li>Reading a book until I feel drowsy...and then taking the nap.</li>
            <li>Much longer neighborhood walks and hikes with Gabe.</li>
            <li>Walking into our sweet town and enjoying the vibe, the activity, the experience.</li>
            <li>Lunch at a quaint cafe', just because.</li>
            <li>Calling a friend and going out to dinner.</li>
            <li>Longer, more on point, unrushed visits with my man.</li>
            <li>
              Sitting in quiet reflection, celebrating what I have done well and releasing my missteps (Instead of the other way around
              which I am queen of).
            </li>
            <li>
              Thinking of actually taking up "Nature Journaling". A magical practice I learned from my friend Barb Root. (This is so
              amazing, I recommend you give it a try.) I can connect you with Barb for an intro to nature journaling).
            </li>
            <li>Doing whatever feels good in the moment, not whatever I thought "should" be done.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>I am not abandoning my purpose. I am honoring it, by honoring myself.</p>

          <p>Did you know that we were not put here to GRIND.</p>

          <p>This part is important:</p>

          <p>
            Women of my generation were conditioned to keep going. To push through. To push ourselves. To be productive, even in our
            rest. To fill the silence. And through all of that noise, somewhere I or we forgot:
          </p>

          <p>Weekends are not rewards.</p>
          <p>They are rights.</p>
          <p>We need softness.</p>
          <p>We need joy.</p>
          <p>We need pauses.</p>
          <p>We need time that is not measured by OUTPUT.</p>

          <p>A vibrant life, the one you and I believe in so fiercely, is built as much in rest as in action.</p>

          <p>SO, Here is my New Weekend philosophy. (Two weekends in).</p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Be slow.</li>
            <li>Be thoughtful.</li>
            <li>Be joyful.</li>
            <li>Be playful.</li>
            <li>Be lazy.</li>
            <li>Be unstructured.</li>
            <li>Be spontaneous.</li>
            <li>Be free.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Not every weekend will look the same. I love that! How about you?</p>

          <p>The structure I follow now is simple:</p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>If it feels nourishing, I say yes.</li>
            <li>If it feels draining, I say NO.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>That is my new boundary. My new compass. My new weekend epiphany. AND the good news is it's changing me in all the right ways.</p>

          <p>Let rest be your new act of power.</p>

          <p>Let weekends become your sanctuary.</p>

          <p>Let joy return to your calendar.</p>

          <p>A weekend well spent brings a week of content.</p>

          <p>I am getting many requests for my Thanksgiving recipes. Here are a few of my plantstrong favorites and I will be making these again this Thanksgiving.</p>

          <h3>Good Garlicky Mashed Potatoes (Ann Esselstyn, Pg. 138, The Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease Cookbook)</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>6 medium gold potatoes</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons nutritional yeast</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons fresh garlic (2-3 cloves)</li>
            <li>2 cups non-dairy milk (I use the potato cooking water as needed since I do not do milk of any sort)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary (sometimes I use fresh)</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
          </ul>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Cut the potatoes, including the skin, into 1 inch chunks. Place them into a large pot, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Cook until tender, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain the potatoes (save the liquid), transfer to a large bowl, and mash.</li>
            <li>Add the nutritional yeast, garlic, and liquid of choice. Mash until smooth, adding extra liquid as needed since nutritional yeast soaks it up.</li>
            <li>Stir in the rosemary and black pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Ann recommends folding in 1-2 cups of finely chopped cooked kale. I may try that this year.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Ann Esselstyn's Mommy's Mushroom Gravy</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2-3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>12 ounces sliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>2 cups vegetable broth</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons white miso</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons whole wheat flour or gluten-free flour mixture</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons low sodium tamari or soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cooking sherry (optional, I use it)</li>
            <li>Black pepper to taste</li>
          </ul>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Saute the onion and garlic with a bit of water or veggie broth until they begin to caramelize, 4-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add sliced mushrooms. They should release liquid, but supplement with water or broth if needed. Cook until mushrooms are soft.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the vegetable broth, miso, flour, tamari or soy sauce, cooking sherry, and any extra broth until smooth.</li>
            <li>Add the wet ingredients to the mushrooms and continue to stir.</li>
            <li>Cook down the mix to your liking and finish with black pepper.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Sweet Potato Casserole (eatplant-based.com)</h3>
          <p>Base:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>5 sweet potatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup non-dairy milk (soy or almond)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup maple or date syrup</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon nutmeg</li>

          </ul>
          <p>Topping:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>1 1/4 cups old-fashioned gluten-free rolled oats</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons whole wheat or other gluten-free flour</li>

          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-1">

            <li>Preheat the oven to 350.</li>
            <li>Mash the sweet potatoes with a potato masher or hand mixer. Add the remaining base ingredients and mix. Keep topping ingredients separate.</li>
            <li>For the topping, blend rolled oats until coarsely chopped. Combine with the remaining topping ingredients in a bowl. The flour should be damp, not dry or very wet; add more non-dairy milk if needed. It should stay crumbly.</li>
            <li>Spread the topping over the sweet potatoes in a casserole dish. Bake about 30 minutes until golden brown. Cool slightly before serving and serve warm.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Tips and tricks:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Use a 2 quart casserole dish.</li>
            <li>Nut-free: pecans are optional.</li>
            <li>Make ahead: cover well and keep in the fridge until ready to bake.</li>
            <li>Storage: store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for 5-7 days.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Super Salad with Balsamic Dressing (EatPlant-Based)</h3>
          <p>Salad:</p>

          </ul>

          <h3>Pumpkin Pie Tart (Forks Over Knives)</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>1 1/2 cups rolled oats (gluten-free works)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup flaxseed meal, divided</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons almond butter</li>
            <li>1 cup unsweetened plant milk, divided</li>
            <li>1 15 oz can pumpkin</li>
            <li>1/3 cup chopped, pitted whole dates</li>
            <li>1/4 cup pure maple syrup</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons arrowroot powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon sea salt</li>
          </ul>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Preheat oven to 375.</li>
            <li>In a food processor, combine oats, 3 tablespoons flaxseed meal, and almond butter. Pulse until mixed. With the processor running, slowly add 2-4 tablespoons of milk until the mixture clings together and is slightly moistened.</li>
            <li>Press the mixture onto the bottom and up the sides of a 9 inch tart pan with a removable bottom.</li>
            <li>For the filling, combine the remaining 1 tablespoon flaxseed meal with 1/4 cup water and let stand for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the flax mixture to a food processor with pumpkin, 3/4 cup milk, dates, maple syrup, arrowroot, pumpkin pie spice, vanilla, and salt. Process until smooth and spread into the crust.</li>
            <li>Bake 50-55 minutes or until the filling is set. Cool on a wire rack for 30 minutes, then chill 2-8 hours. Serve.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Stuffing</h3>
          <p>I wing this using a seasoned stuffing mix (gluten-free works). Follow the directions for the mix.</p>
          <p>I always include sauteed onions, celery, kale, mushrooms, and carrots. Combine everything and toss in some unsweetened dried cranberries (not too many). Bake in a 350-375 oven until heated through and a bit crunchy on top.</p>

          <h3>Corn Muffins</h3>
          <p>Serve with maple syrup sweetened honey butter. (There is a recipe in the recipe file on the website.)</p>

          <p>
            This is the second year since I was married (2/6/65) that I am not having Thanksgiving at my house. My daughter invited us all
            to her house where almost the whole family will gather, dogs included. (We will miss Peyton who is studying abroad in Portugal
            with Villanova).
          </p>
          <p>I will bring all of the above to Andrea's house as we have a mixed group...there will be the traditional Thanksgiving fixins plus the above. I love Thanksgiving. How about you?</p>

          <p>Enjoy,</p>

          <p>The holidays have a way of stirring up memories. Some sweet, some painful and some so intertwined that they make us laugh and tear up in the same breath.</p>

          <p>This week a very dear long time friend texted me: "I am hosting Thanksgiving this year. I hope I can hold back the tears."</p>

          <p>Her husband passed away over a year ago.</p>

          <p>Her words made me stop and wonder. Can we be genuinely happy and deeply sad in the same moment?</p>

          <p>I believe the answer is yes. And I believe that not only is it possible but it is actually healing.</p>

          <p>Grief doesn’t really leave, it kind of softens. Grief is not a one and done chapter. It doesn’t wrap itself up neatly and fly away when the calendar flips.</p>

          <p>Grief is love that has nowhere to go. It is the echo of a life shared. And during the holidays, that echo is loud.</p>

          <p>
            But I think it is possible to laugh from your belly and still feel that tug in your heart. Yup you can cook the meal, pour the
            hot cider, set the table, put on your party shoes and be excited for the doorbell to ring and still miss the person who is not
            there. YES, YOU can feel joy without betraying your sorrow.
          </p>

          <p>The heart can hold both Sorrow and JOY.</p>

          <p>
            Tears do not cancel out joy. My friend worried that tears might ruin the day. NOPE, on the flip, tears do not take away anything.
            Tears add meaning in the most authentic and JOYFUL way.
          </p>

          <p>Tears say:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>"I loved someone deeply."</li>
            <li>"I am still finding my way."</li>
            <li>"I am doing the brave thing, even though it hurts."</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            So why not let joy and sorrow sit together? Let tears come. They are just love in liquid form. But let smiles come too. They are
            proof you are still living forward.
          </p>

          <p>
            So go ahead with love in your heart, share memories, say their name, tell funny stories, that all keeps them close. Let others
            help you, you do not have to be the strong one every moment. And most of all, make space for the messy mix. The human heart can
            multi-task.
          </p>

          <p>
            I think aging brings wisdom, courage, resilience and yes even loss. But it also brings a deeper understanding of the human
            heart. If this holiday season brings you both JOY and SORROW, let it. It just means you have lived, loved and continue to grow
            in your own special time and way.
          </p>

          <p>AND IF TEARS FALL...LET THEM SPARKLE.</p>

          <p>Hugs,</p>

          <p>

          <p>
            Thanksgiving has always been my favorite holiday, simple, heartfelt, and overflowing with gratitude. My sweet momma was the
            Queen of Thanksgiving. She taught me, by example, how to welcome people into your home and create a day that feels cherished,
            warm and unforgettable. Her table was never about perfection. It was all about presence. (Someone once told me, perhaps my mom,
            when hosting, never worry about what you put on the table, the key to success is who you put on the chairs.)
          </p>

          <p>
            When I married and moved from upstate New York to California in 1965, my husband and I shared our first Thanksgiving alone in a
            lovely restaurant. We didn’t know anyone, YET. By the next Thanksgiving our tiny, one bedroom apartment was bursting with
            friends, laughter, mismatched dishes and the beginning of a tradition that lasted more than SIX DECADES.
          </p>

          <p>
            For 61 years, with only a very few (4) exceptions, my home has been the hub of Thanksgiving. I have roasted the turkeys, mashed
            the taters, baked the sweet potatoes, made the green bean casserole and baked the pies. I welcomed the guests and carried my
            mom’s baton with pride and purpose.
          </p>

          <p>
            BUT, this year I will not be hosting. HMMMMMM? Serious “emotional reflex” at the thought. I won’t even share all of the dark
            thoughts that surfaced but they ended with, “the old lady is gaining ground”. Soooooooooo after a long discussion with that
            voice in my head, ya know the one that is wired for survival not happiness, I emerged victorious. I got my s_ _ t together and
            realized what a wonderful gift I was just given by my sweet, daughter’s offer to host. But I must be perfectly honest, passing
            the baton felt emotional. It made me feel old. A little empty. A little without purpose. I am so happy I caught myself. Why
            would I deny my sweet girl the absolute delight and joy that comes with hosting Thanksgiving. Why did I refuse, at first, to
            hear the excitement in her voice. The joy. The pride. Sometimes I can be a “hamster brain”. It took me a while (several days)
            before I knew, with a joyful heart that my job was done. But I was finally ok. I knew with a full heart that the legacy had
            taken root.
          </p>

          <p>
            She is becoming her generation’s queen of Thanksgiving! One proud momma here. I hope I taught her well. Especially this one
            thing, no matter how much you plan and prepare when the doorbell rings the party takes on a life of its own. Just go with it. It
            will never be as you imagined but I know it will be warm, welcoming and delicious.
          </p>

          <p>
            Watching her prepare with a joyful heart, planning, decorating, cooking and soon welcoming, is one of the most beautiful gifts I
            could receive.
          </p>

          <p>
            Surely family holiday traditions are not meant to be the same. They are meant to evolve, to grow, to be loved by the next pair of
            hands. There is definitely a buzz of anticipation in the air, with excitement over the coming Thanksgiving day at AA. (Aunt A).
          </p>

          <p>So this year, I will sit at her beautiful table with a full and grateful heart.</p>

          <p>
            Happy Thanksgiving my Rebellious friends. May your day be filled with love, family, friends, and gratitude that spans
            generations.
          </p>

            There comes a point in life, often quietly, sometimes all at once, when all of a sudden we become aware of time in a new way. No,
            not just the time on the clock, or the number on the calendar, but the untenable truth that our time is finite. Not in a morbid
            way, in a clarifying way. Almost like a soft whisper asking: "What will you do with your time left?"

            Psychologists call this time perspective. The emotional and mental lens through which we view our past, present, and future.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is how I like to look at it. How we feel about time is how we use it. And as women in the richest chapters of our lives we
            have choices. Will we drift? Or will we align our actions with what truly matters?
          </p>

          <p>When you feel time differently, you live differently.</p>

          <p>
            In our younger years, time felt endless, there was always a "later", a "someday", a "next year". But now there is an awareness and
            honesty that changes things. We become more intentional. More discerning. More of what feels worth our minutes, and what
            definitely does not. Time shifts from background noise to guiding force and I look at that as a gift.
          </p>

          <p>Time is not chasing us, it is inviting us. It is inviting us to be aware of it.</p>

          <p>So:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Stop wasting energy on what drains you.</li>
            <li>Choose joy without apology.</li>
            <li>Use your voice openly, boldly, loudly.</li>
            <li>Prioritize health and movement.</li>
            <li>Create instead of consume.</li>
            <li>Savor instead of rush.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Be mindful with every tick of the clock. Ask yourself, "Is this how you want to spend the rest of your life?" When the answer is
            YES, you will feel it in your bones. When the answer is NO, time nudges you to adjust.
          </p>

          <p>So what does it look like to live in alignment with time?</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Be honest about what matters now, not 10 years from now.</li>
            <li>Say yes only when your heart truly says yes.</li>
            <li>Let go of someday.</li>
            <li>Nurture only warm and reciprocal friendships.</li>
            <li>Invest in your health like your time depends on it, it does.</li>
            <li>Do one small thing daily that your future self will appreciate.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We REBELS 55+ know a truth the young do not know, YET.</p>

          <p>
            Time becomes more meaningful as it becomes more limited. And this is not something to fear, it is actually something to honor.
            When we align our actions with time, we stop living on autopilot. We step into purpose, clarity and freedom.
          </p>

          <p>I REPEAT: Time and the clock are not the enemy, they are the teacher. Time becomes more meaningful as it becomes more limited.</p>

          <p>When we align our actions with time, we STOP living on autopilot. We step into purpose, clarity and freedom.</p>

          <p>
            So I encourage you to live each day with intention, choose wisely, love deeply and always strive to be your best authentic self
            every minute of each day.
          </p>

          <p>Hugs,</p>

            I am sure we are all in agreement that we have lots to learn from this fabulous lady. She was definitely a woman who made being
            YOURSELF a fashion superpower. I have wondered what we could learn from her.
          </p>

          <p>There are fashion icons a plenty and there is Diane Keaton, absolutely a category of 1.</p>

          <p>
            In my mind she remains the queen of personal style: hats, tailored menswear, wide belts, turtlenecks, dramatic coats and
            unmistakable black and white confidence. She did not follow fashion. Nope, for me she was fashion. She appeared unafraid to show
            up exactly as she wanted to be seen. UNAPOLOGETICALLY!
          </p>

          <p>Your style becomes iconic the moment you stop asking permission.</p>

          <p>
            <strong>Noteworthy:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>
              Diane&apos;s consistent menswear inspired look was not repetition, it was self-definition. She turned her personal uniform into a
              power statement. She found her lane and claimed it. Consistency creates confidence.
            </li>
            <li>
              She used accessories like exclamation points. Hats, oversized glasses, bold oversized belts, quirky shoes. Accessories are not
              after thoughts, they are punctuation. They say, I know who I am.
            </li>
            <li>
              She knew the power of tailoring. She wore clothes that fit with intention. Tailoring elevates everything, and she was great at
              honoring her shape, without relying on trends.
            </li>
            <li>Age is not a style expiration date. Her incredible style only sharpened with age. She dressed for creativity not chronology.</li>
            <li>
              Diane dressed in collaboration with herself. She said, "Style is about choices you make to express yourself". Her clothes are
              expressions not costumes.
            </li>
            <li>
              She brought humor and humanity into fashion. Her playful approach reminds us that fashion should be fun. When you smile while
              dressing, know it is a sign you have chosen well.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold">Lessons learned from the fabulous Diane Keaton</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Own your own signature style. In fact, rock it.</li>
            <li>Repeat outfits proudly.</li>
            <li>Accessorize with intention.</li>
            <li>Let your personality lead.</li>
            <li>Choose tailoring over trends.</li>
            <li>NEVER, apologize for standing out.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Diane Keaton showed us that style does not fade with age, personality strengthens it.</p>

          <p>
            I am convinced that fashion is the visible expression of your inner rebellion. So whether your style is classic, colorful, boho,
            elegant, minimalist, dramatic, or whimsical take a page from Diane. Wear it fully. Wear it freely. WEAR IT FABULOUSLY.
          </p>

          <p>Hugs,</p>

            I could be wrong here, but I believe there comes a moment in a woman’s life, somewhere between wisdom gained and patience lost,
            when she realizes something powerful. She realizes she no longer needs permission to look and feel incredible. Welcome to that
            moment.
          </p>

          <p>
            As Rebellious Agers, we are rewriting outdated ideas about how women of any age should dress, let alone women our age. But let’s
            stick to us for now. This chapter of life calls loudly for mischief, mystery, confidence, maybe a little bling and a wardrobe
            that reflects YOU and says here I am in the best possible way.
          </p>

          <p>
            The way that makes you feel awesome and know that, that awesomeness and confidence is catchy. Here is how I am looking at style
            right now.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold">My rebellious style reminders</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Wear what makes your soul hum. If it lifts your energy and makes you smile, it belongs on you.</li>
            <li>DON’T dress to disappear. Presence is in. Shrinking is out.</li>
            <li>
              Absolutely claim a signature piece. Statement glasses, bold earrings, a scarf or wrap that sings—whatever it is, choose it and
              wear it.
            </li>
            <li>Please do not follow every trend. Remember trends are suggestions not requirements.</li>
            <li>Do play with color. Color is medicine for the soul. Allow it to wake up your spirit.</li>
            <li>Do NOT apologize for being seen. You are not too much. You are exactly perfect and a smile to the world.</li>
            <li>
              Do choose comfort AND style. Yes they go together. Figure it out. Comfort is the new luxury, and it belongs to you.
            </li>
            <li>Do not save outfits for special occasions. You are no longer in kindergarten. Wear the clothes NOW. You are the occasion.</li>
            <li>Don’t ignore fit. Tailoring is magic. Let your clothes honor your body.</li>
            <li>Do trust your mirror. And your intuition. (WYKYK)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Fashion is not vanity, it is expression AND identity. It is declaring without a doubt that YOU ARE HERE. YOU ARE VIBRANT. AND
            THAT YOU ARE NOT DONE SHINING.
          </p>

          <p>
            To me Rebellious Aging means showing up as the fullest and most authentic version of ourselves. Unapologetically, courageously,
            and always with sparkle.
          </p>

          <p>Hugs,</p>

          <p>
            Lately I have been wrestling greatly with those sneaky, "sketch", familiar whispers that tell me to stay small. Ya know the ones,
            right? "Who do YOU think you are?" "Why would anyone pay attention to you?" "You are so OLD, stay in your lane. Don&apos;t be so
            out there."
          </p>

          <p>And so it goes, the chorus of limiting beliefs. You have heard it, right?</p>

          <p>
            The truth is, even at 83.5, even with decades of life, learning, loss, ups and downs, strength, weakness, and lots of sparkle
            behind me, those old voices still pop up often and with vigor and determination. They are persistent. They are loud. And they are
            wrong—and only to be put immediately in their rightful place, OUT OF YOUR WAY.
          </p>

          <p>I know I am not alone.</p>

          <p>
            Brene Brown reminds us that "Vulnerability is not weakness. It is our greatest measure of courage." So maybe sharing ourselves and
            our ideas and our joy and our spunk is vulnerable. For sure it is exposing and at the same time, possibly brave.
          </p>

          <p>
            Brene teaches us that being willing to be seen is the most courageous act of all. When we step forward trembling, we are not being
            fragile, we are being fierce. (I needed that, how about you?)
          </p>

          <p>
            Mel Robbins reminds us: "YOU are one decision away from a completely different life." Yup, limiting beliefs freeze us. Mel calls
            it the hesitation trap. She has her 5 second window theory; in that 5 seconds fear talks louder than our dreams.
          </p>

          <p>
            So what the heck is the antidote? Tough up AND act anyway. Move before the limiting belief can shut you down. (I am actually here
            because of Mel&apos;s 5 Second Rule, a crazy story for another day). Take the tiny step, post the message, start the project.
            Share the spark.
          </p>

          <p>Courage first, confidence later.</p>

          <p>
            Buddha teaches: "What you think, you become." Limiting beliefs are not just thoughts, they are patterns that shape who we allow
            ourselves to be. Buddha reminds us that these beliefs are illusions. They are simply stories, not destiny.
          </p>

          <p>So change your thoughts. Change your path. Observe the fear. Loosen its grip. Choose compassion and dissolve the judgment.</p>

          <p>
            Jay Shetty says, "Don&apos;t let other people&apos;s doubts become your reality." But here is the twist. Sometimes the "other
            people" live in our own minds. They are echoes from years ago, from culture, from conditioning, and many from moments that were
            not our fault. Jay teaches that we must separate identity from the noise.
          </p>

          <p>Truth is we are not our limiting beliefs. We are the awareness behind them.</p>

          <p>Remember, our brains are not wired for happiness. They are wired for survival.</p>

          <p>January has a way of arriving boldly.</p>

          <p>
            Everywhere we turn, we are told it&apos;s time to reinvent ourselves, to fix what is broken, tighten the reins, and come charging
            out of the gate with bold resolutions and bigger goals. As if the turning of the calendar demands urgency.
          </p>

          <p>I am thinking, but what if it doesn&apos;t?</p>

          <p>What if the most rebellious thing we could do at the start of a new year is begin GENTLY?</p>

          <p>As we age, many of us discover something powerful.</p>

          <p>We don&apos;t need more force, we need more discernment.</p>

          <p>We don&apos;t need louder voices, we need to listen inward.</p>

          <p>We don&apos;t need to become someone new, we need to come home to ourselves.</p>

          <p>This is the heart of Rebellious Aging.</p>

          <p>
            Aging isn&apos;t a race against time. It&apos;s a relationship with it. And like any meaningful relationship, it thrives on
            attention, honesty, and care and NOT pressure.
          </p>

          <p>So how about this? Instead of resolutions, I&apos;m inviting a gentle rebellion.</p>

          <p>A rebellion against the &quot;Hustle Culture&quot; that tells us slower means weaker.</p>

          <p>A rebellion against the idea that January is a deadline.</p>

          <p>A rebellion against outdated beliefs that aging should make us smaller, quieter, and less curious.</p>

          <p>
            Gentle rebellion looks like nourishment instead of punishment. Movement that feels respectful, not forced. Confidence that grows
            quietly, rooted in self-trust rather than comparison.
          </p>

          <p>It looks like allowing yourself to re-enter mid-month, mid-thought, mid-life, without apology.</p>

          <p>
            If you are feeling behind, you are not. If you are unsure where to begin, you already have. Beginning again doesn&apos;t require a
            clean slate, it only asks for an honest starting place.
          </p>

          <p>
            So let me leave you with one simple reflection as we move into the year ahead. What would it look like to treat this year as a
            relationship with yourself, rather than a project to manage?
          </p>

          <p>Ya know, NO RUSH, NO RIGHT ANSWER, JUST CURIOSITY.</p>

          <p>Let&apos;s begin again, right where we are.</p>

            One of the greatest gifts of this chapter of my life has been learning that meaningful work doesn&apos;t have to stay within
            generational lines.
          </p>

          <p>
            I want to introduce you to Enzo Sison, my creative partner and the person who has helped bring Rebellious Aging to life in ways I
            could not have done on my own.
          </p>

          <p>
            Enzo is a graduate of Cal Poly and the founder of Design Prism (design-prism.com), where he helps people and organizations
            translate ideas into clean, functional, and meaningful digital spaces. He brings clarity, patience, and an uncanny ability to
            turn a swirl of my random thoughts into something structured and usable.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond his design work, Enzo is also training for the 2028 Olympics in pole vaulting as part of the Philippine Team, an endeavor
            that requires discipline, focus, and long-term vision. Those qualities show up in our work together every single day.
          </p>

          <p>
            Enzo created my website and my private Facebook community, but his role goes far beyond design. He listens. He asks thoughtful
            questions. He encourages and discourages. He keeps me grounded when my ideas run ahead of logistics. He also drives me to my
            &quot;talks&quot;, is my tech support and cheerfully schleps when needed. Cheers for Enzo!
          </p>

          <p>
            What I cherish most about working with Enzo is the mutual respect. I bring many decades of lived experience, perspective, and
            purpose. He brings modern tools, technical expertise, and calm execution. Neither is more important than the other. Together we
            create forward motion.
          </p>

          <p>
            This partnership is proof that age is not a barrier, it is in fact an asset. When generations collaborate with trust and
            curiosity, something meaningful happens.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am grateful for Enzo, for our shared work, and for what we continue to build one thoughtful step at a time.

          <p>Most of us haven&apos;t. And that is not a coincidence.</p>

          <p>
            Protein deficiency is extremely rare in developed countries like the U.S. What we see far more often is the opposite problem:
            too much protein, especially from animal sources, along with too little fiber and too few protective plant compounds.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold">How much protein do we really need?</p>

          <p>
            Most adults need approximately 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. For many people, that comes out to roughly 45-70
            grams per day, depending on size, age, and activity level.
          </p>

          <p>Here is the key takeaway: Most Americans already exceed this amount by a wide margin.</p>

          <p>And yes, this includes people who eat mostly or entirely plants.</p>

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold">What the science says (without the hype)</p>

          <p>
            One of the clearest voices in this conversation is Christopher Gardner, a respected nutrition researcher at Stanford University.
          </p>

          <p>
            Dr. Gardner has spent decades studying dietary patterns. He has studied omnivores, vegetarians, vegans, low-carb, and low-fat
            diets, and his message is consistently reassuring: if people eat a balanced, calorie-adequate diet, protein intake takes care of
            itself.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beans, lentils, tofu, tempeh, whole grains, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds all contain protein. When you eat enough food
            and a variety to meet your energy needs, you almost automatically meet your protein needs as well.
          </p>

          <p>There is no special &quot;protein magic&quot; reserved for animal foods.</p>

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold">The real concern isn&apos;t too little protein</p>

          <p>It&apos;s too much, particularly from animal sources.</p>

          <p>Excess protein, especially when it crowds out fiber-rich foods, has been associated with:</p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Increased kidney stress (especially for those with underlying kidney issues)</li>
            <li>Higher calcium loss from bones</li>
            <li>
              Elevated IGF-1 levels (Insulin-like Growth Factor 1). Low levels are linked to heart disease and high levels are linked to
              certain cancers.
            </li>
            <li>Increased inflammation and cardiovascular strain when protein comes largely from red and processed meats</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Plant protein, on the other hand, comes packaged with fiber, antioxidants, phytonutrients, and anti-inflammatory compounds,
            nutrients that most of us need far more of.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold">What happens on a whole-food, plant-based diet?</p>

          <p>People who eat a whole-food, plant-based diet consistently meet their protein needs while also:</p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Improving cholesterol levels</li>
            <li>Supporting gut health</li>
            <li>Reducing inflammation</li>
            <li>Lowering the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes</li>
          </ul>

          <p>In other words: You don&apos;t need to chase protein. You simply need to eat real food.</p>

          <p>
            So if you are eating a variety of whole plant foods, enough calories for your body, beans, lentils, whole grains, fruits,
            veggies, nuts, and seeds, you are getting enough protein.
          </p>

          <p>The &quot;PROTEIN PANIC&quot; sells products, but it does not reflect reality.</p>

          <p>Confidence not fear belongs on your plate.</p>

        <p className="italic mb-8">By Suzanne</p>

        <div className="prose max-w-none space-y-4 mb-16">
          <p>As we step into 2026, I want to make something clear:</p>

          <p>
            This is not the year to fade quietly into sensible neutrals and invisible choices. This is the year to show up with curiosity,
            confidence, and maybe a little swagger.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unapologetic style is my third pillar for a reason. It is not about chasing trends or dressing &quot;age-appropriately&quot;
            (whatever that is supposed to mean). It&apos;s about using clothing, color, texture, and personal flair as a form of
            self-expression and self-respect.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold">Let&apos;s talk 2026 style energy (not rules)</p>

          <p>
            Fashion forecasters agree on one thing for 2026. Individuality is in. Polish meets playfulness. Comfort no longer apologizes.
          </p>

          <p>
            You will see a blend of relaxed silhouettes with intentional structure, flowing layers paired with bold accents, timeless basics
            elevated by one confident statement. Brooches for certain.
          </p>

          <p>So be clear here, you don&apos;t need a new wardrobe. You need a new point of view.</p>

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold">The colors are speaking, are you listening?</p>

          <p>The color story for 2026 is deliciously expressive.</p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Rich berries and plums (hello confidence)</li>
            <li>Warm terracotta and clay tones (grounded and strong)</li>
            <li>Soft but luminous blues and greens (calm with presence)</li>
            <li>Classic black and white, used boldly not timidly</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Remember color isn&apos;t frivolous, color is communication, and in 2026, it says &quot;I am still here, and I am enjoying
            myself.&quot;
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold">Unapologetic style is an inside job</p>

          <p>
            Here is the part fashion magazines rarely talk about. When we begin to feel vibrant in our bodies, ya know nourished, moving,
            energized, our style will naturally shift. Shoulders lift. Choices get braver. The mirror becomes less of a critic and more of a
            collaborator. Right?
          </p>

          <p>
            Unapologetic style isn&apos;t about impressing others. Nope! It is about aligning the outside with how you feel on the inside.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold">A gentle rebel tip (no pressure allowed)</p>

          <p>Before buying anything new, try this:</p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Put on one outfit you already own</li>
            <li>Add one unexpected element, like a scarf, bold necklace, color pop, brooch, fabulous gloves, or a jacket</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Ask yourself, do I feel more like me and in sync with a new look for a new year with my own stuff but with a new spin? That&apos;s
            the signal, follow it.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold">And while we are in this moment, let&apos;s whisper about thrifting</p>

          <p>
            There for sure is something quietly rebellious about finding treasure where others may overlook it. Thrifting invites
            creativity, sustainability, and storytelling. And it removes the pressure to &quot;keep up&quot;. We will talk more about this
            soon, after I have a gab session with my granddaughter Carson who lives in Boston and is my thrifting inspiration.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold">A question for you as we begin 2026</p>

          <p>What if this is the year you stop feeling compelled to explain your choices?</p>

          <p>No disclaimers.</p>

          <p>No &quot;I know I&apos;m too old for this, but...&quot;.</p>

          <p>No apologies.</p>

          <p>Just presence. Personality. And how about a little sparkle.</p>

          <p>Unapologetic style isn&apos;t about fashion. It is about permission.</p>

          <p>And in case you were wondering</p>

          <p>You already have it.</p>

          <p>
            For so many years, I thought confidence meant having it all together before I took the next step. If I could just be better,
            calmer, more polished, then I would finally feel ready.
          </p>

          <p>But life has taught me something far more honest and far more freeing.</p>

          <p>I don&apos;t need to be perfect. I just need to keep going.</p>

          <p>
            Perfection is a moving target. It keeps us overthinking, shrinking, and waiting for a version of ourselves that does not
            exist.
          </p>

          <p>
            Progress, however, is available right now. One decision. One conversation. One hard moment where you stay present instead of
            walking away from yourself.
          </p>

          <p>
            Confidence is not about staying calm. NOPE! It&apos;s about staying.
          </p>

          <p>
            Staying when your mind gets loud. Staying when you feel unsure. Staying long enough to remember who you are and what matters
            most.
          </p>

          <p>
            If today feels messy, good. Messy means you are in motion. Messy means you are learning. Messy means you are still in the
            arena of your own life.
          </p>

          <p>
            So take the pressure off perfect and put your energy into practice. Keep showing up. Keep choosing your values. Keep being kind
            to yourself while you build a life that feels true.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is how we age boldly, not by getting everything right, but by refusing to quit on ourselves.

        <div className="prose max-w-none space-y-4 mb-16">
          <p>In my opinion there is something beautifully subversive about thrifting. In a world constantly nudging us to buy more, faster and newer, well it all makes my head spin. On the other hand, thrifting seems to ask us to slow down, look closer, and choose intentionally.</p>
          <p>Is it trendy? I am not sure. I am sure it is thoughtful.</p>
          <p>Thrifting aligns perfectly with my <strong>third pillar, unapologetic style.</strong> It encourages creativity over conformity. It gets you out of the “keep up” mindset. It definitely values story, quality, and individuality.</p>
          <p><strong>When you thrift, you are not buying an outfit. YOU ARE DISCOVERING AN OUTFIT.</strong></p>
          <p>It is good to be aware that <strong>FAST FASHION has consequences.</strong> Yes it does. I challenge you to consider the following issues, environmental, ethical and emotional. <strong><em>Thrifting offers a gentle alternative</em></strong><em> that feels empowering rather than restrictive.</em></p>
          <p><strong>Thrifting quietly says, I don’t need excess to feel stylish. I value craftsmanship, history, tradition and creativity. </strong><strong>I chose consciously, not compulsively.</strong></p>
          <p>The joy of the hunt and the excitement of finding something fabulous at a fraction of the price…that is Rebellious Aging.</p>
          <p>Thrifting is definitely a different type of experience. It requires staying power and invites PATIENCE. Curiosity. Play. Achievement. SUCCESS.</p>
          <p><strong>Some days you find nothing. Other days you find MAGIC.</strong></p>
          <p>When you wear something secondhand, there is freedom in knowing you didn’t buy it to impress. You bought it because it felt right.</p>
          <p><strong>A Rebel Question. The next time you shop, ponder the following question. <em>Does this feel aligned with who I want to be? Who I am becoming?</em> (Works for closets, also.)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Thrifting is not about scarcity.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>It is about intention. And that never goes out of style.</strong></p>

        <div className="prose max-w-none space-y-4 mb-16">
          <p>A few weeks ago, during a casual conversation, someone asked me if I eat oatmeal.</p>
          <p>“Yes,” I offered.</p>
          <p>Then came the zinger.</p>
          <p>“I can see its effects on your face. You need to stop eating it.”</p>
          <p>Wait… WHAT?</p>
          <p>For a brief moment, and yes, even at 83, I doubted myself. This single, IMO, careless comment poked at my confidence.</p>
          <p>But here’s the truth, no one can see oatmeal in/on your face. Nor in your wrinkles, texture or radiance. Oatmeal does not create aging lines, puffiness or sagging.</p>
          <p>In fact, OATMEAL is a very supportive food. It steadies blood sugar, reduces inflammation, improves gut health, calms skin, and helps your heart health.</p>
          <p>People use oatmeal in skincare masks because of how healing it is.</p>
          <p><strong>So if oatmeal shows up anywhere, it is in your health not on your face.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>So what is the real story here?</strong></p>
          <p><strong><em>THE REAL STORY HERE IS SELF-DOUBT</em></strong></p>
          <p>So even after decades of reading, learning and teaching the fabulousness of a plant filled life, one random comment made me second guess myself big-time.</p>
          <p><strong>Those limiting beliefs sneak in with vigor.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>? “Maybe I don’t know enough?”</strong></p>
          <p><strong>? “Maybe I am not doing this right?”</strong></p>
          <p><strong>? “Maybe my age shows more than I realize?”</strong></p>
          <p><strong>NO.</strong> <strong>NO.</strong> <strong>NO.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>We must stay aware regarding how quickly we hand our confidence over to someone else’s opinion.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>So here is THE LESSON! Ready? VET YOUR SOURCES.</strong></p>
          <p>If someone says I see the effects of oats on your face or whole grains age you, or cabs cause wrinkles. <strong>Your first thought should be, source,</strong> <strong>please?</strong></p>
          <p><strong>It’s just NOISE if it does not come from a credible source. </strong><strong><em>Here at RA we do not build our choices on noise.</em></strong></p>
          <p>I could have believed the comment, changed my breakfast, felt self conscious (<em>Full disclosure I did study my face in the mirror many times),</em> shrunk inside myself. I could have, right? Yup.</p>
          <p><strong>But instead, I caught the wobble, and I turned it into wisdom, clarity and this blog.</strong></p>
          <p>This is what Rebellious Aging is all about. We do <strong>NOT</strong> let myths define us. We do <strong>NOT</strong> give away our power. <strong>NOPE! We stand firmly in truth, science and sparkle.</strong></p>
          <p><strong><em>You bet I will be having my oats and wild blueberries tomorrow and everyday after.</em></strong> <em>(Join me?)</em></p>

        <div className="prose max-w-none space-y-4 mb-16">
          <p><strong>A Rebellious Aging Perspective</strong></p>
          <p>We have all heard the phrase “fresh is best.” But what does that mean when it comes to vegetables, nutrition and real life?</p>
          <p>Do vegetables lose their nutritional value the moment they are harvested?</p>
          <p>Does chopping them destroy their nutrients?</p>
          <p>Should we be concerned if our broccoli has been in the fridge for a few days?</p>
          <p>The short answer is NO.</p>
          <p>Once a vegetable is harvested, it is no longer connected to the plant, but it remains biologically active for several days and up to a couple of weeks after harvest. But they begin losing significant nutritional value, especially vitamins within 24 to 72 hours. So during storage some vitamins decline slowly while others remain stable. Most vegetables retain a large portion of whatever nutritional value they have for days or even weeks. The biggest factors affecting nutrient loss are time and temperature.</p>
          <p>Vitamin C is the most sensitive nutrient. B vitamins are moderately sensitive, while minerals, fiber and many antioxidants are very stable.</p>
          <p><strong>Refrigeration significantly slows nutrient loss. Proper storage matters more than immediate consumption. For example, spinach may lose 30-50% of vitamin C after a week if not refrigerated. Carrots retain most nutrients for weeks when refrigerated. Refrigerated broccoli retains much of its nutrition for several days.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Frozen vegetables </strong>are often harvested at peak ripeness, lightly blanched, and frozen quickly. Because of this, frozen vegetables frequently retain equal or greater nutritional value than fresh vegetables that have traveled long distances. <strong>Frozen vegetables are convenient, affordable, and nutritionally sound.</strong></p>
          <p>Chopping vegetables does not automatically destroy nutrients. Some nutrients like vitamin C may decline slowly with exposure to air. However, chopping can increase availability of other beneficial compounds. For example, chopping broccoli activates enzymes that increase sulforaphane formation. Sulphoraphane is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound found in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, brussel sprouts and kale. Chopping and light cooking may increase absorption of beta carotene and lycopene.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Tip: Let chopped broccoli sit for 30-40 minutes before cooking to maximize sulforaphane formation.</em></strong></p>
          <p><strong>Does cooking ruin nutrients? </strong>Not all cooking methods are equal. The best methods are steaming, water sauteing, microwaving, and short roasting at moderate temperatures. Long boiling can lead to nutrient loss into the water, but fiber, minerals, and many anti-oxidants remain intact.</p>
          <p><strong>The Bigger Picture. </strong>The greatest nutritional loss does not come from chopping or storing vegetables. <strong><em>It comes from avoiding vegetables because of fear of doing it wrong.</em></strong></p>
          <p><strong>Rebellious Aging is not about perfection. It IS about consistency, nourishment, enjoyment and good health.</strong></p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-8">1. Choose Structure</h3>
          <p>
            Choose structure over softness. As we age our bodies change. I feel like no matter how hard I try to maintain my muscle tone, I
            see drooping and softening. So soft clothing on a softening frame can make everything look collapsed. Looking stiff here is not
            the goal. Looking intentional is. Think about how sharp uniforms look with their clean lines. Blazers, coats, structured
            knits and tailored trousers and crisp jeans. Structure signals strength.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-8">2. Wear Color on Purpose</h3>
          <p>
            Color signals vitality. Vitality never ages. A bold lip. A red shoe. Crisp white. Earth tones that look intentional. Depth is
            more important than loud.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-8">3. Fit Matters More Than Trends</h3>
          <p>Skip chasing trends. Curate.</p>
          <p>Wear what fits your body. I mean now.</p>
          <p>Tailoring is respect.</p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-8">4. Edit Ruthlessly</h3>
          <p>
            If it is droopy, stretched, faded, or tired, release it. Clothes should support and enhance you, not diminish you.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-8">5. Modernize the Silhouette</h3>
          <p>You do not need to look 25.</p>
          <p>You need to look current.</p>
          <p>Slightly structured. Slightly intentional. Slightly sharp.</p>
          <p>All with your special twist.</p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-8">6. Stand Tall</h3>
          <p>Posture is a big part of your outfit. Do not ignore this. Shoulders back, ears over your shoulders. Chin level.</p>
          <p>Walk in with attitude, (Ya know like you belong, cuz you do).</p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-8">7. Keep Hair Deliberate</h3>
          <p>Silver, cropped, colored, short, long. It doesn&apos;t matter.</p>
          <p>Take time to find your right stylist and cut.</p>
          <p>A great haircut, kept in check, is a must. Make it intentional.</p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-8">8. The Importance of the Bag and Shoes</h3>
          <p>
            I am not talking designer, expensive, overly logoed. One great bag beats five average ones and can make or break your look.
            Shoes too. People always notice shoes. Wear your best. You can put together a great outfit and get dragged right down with your
            bag and shoes. This is your time to shine. Polish them up. Get new heels. You&apos;ve got this.
            Remember power is curated.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-8">9. Claim a Signature</h3>
          <p>Statement glasses.</p>
          <p>A bold piece.</p>
          <p>A great scent.</p>
          <p>Let something be unmistakable to you.</p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-8">10. Dress Like You Expect to be Seen. (ALWAYS)</h3>
          <p>Not for approval.</p>
          <p>Not for attention.</p>
          <p>Because you are alive.</p>
          <p>Age does not diminish presence. It refines it.</p>

          <p>How about this?</p>
          <p>Dress for the role you want to play.</p>
